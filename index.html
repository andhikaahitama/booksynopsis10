It also offers an extraordinarily helpful set of notes and headnotes as well as Introduction&#x2014;all designed for first-time readers of the canticle&#x2014;by Alison Cornish.</p><p><b>Stanley Lombardo</b> is Professor Emeritus of Classics, The University of Kansas.<br><br><b>Alison Cornish</b> is Professor of Italian, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor."Lombardo makes Dante's verses come alive in so many ways that this crowning achievement stands on its own as inspired poetry, readily comprehensible and reliably attentive to the many different registers that the Florentine poet incorporates in his text. Despite its reputation as the most challenging of the three canticles, the <i>Paradiso</i>, in Lombardo's dramatically charged version, becomes remarkably transparent. . . . As is characteristic of his previous translations, Lombardo addresses his version of <i>Paradiso</i> not only to readers but also to listeners and succeeds in recreating the various stages on which the <i>Comedy</i> was originally received and presented: private readings at home and more public oral performances either for small, intimate groups within the palazzo walls or before large crowds in the town square. . . . In her fine Introduction, instructive headnotes to individual cantos, and extensive explanatory endnotes, Alison Cornish provides all the information necessary for a profitable reading of the <i>Paradiso</i>. . . . This handsome bilingual edition is a welcome addition to the large and ever increasing number of annotated translations of Dante's Comedy."<br> &#x2014;Christopher Kleinhenz, Carol Mason Kirk Professor Emeritus of Italian, University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison<br><br>"The distinctive combination of Lombardo's lucid rendering of Dante's poem with Cornish's judicious commentary will make this volume a remarkable resource for both new and seasoned readers. It not only provides the necessary coordinates to comprehend Dante's daring description of eternity but also offers new insights about the work&#x2019;s relation to its historical, philosophical, and literary contexts."<br> &#x2014;Martin Eisner, Associate Professor of Romance Studies, Duke University<br><br>"This translation and commentary are an essential contribution to Dante's reception in English. Stanley Lombardo's translation is accurate, elegant, and transparent, a mirror of the original text. Alison Cornish's commentary is lucid, graceful, and precise, with just the right level of detail; it penetrates and opens the Paradiso's philosophical, scientific, and theological dimensions with authority, balance, sensitivity, and simplicity. Perhaps now more readers will follow Dante to Paradise."<br> &#x2014;Christian Moevs, Associate Professor of Italian, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"Unlike the crowd-pleasing, visceral and eviscerating&nbsp;<i>Inferno</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Paradiso</i>&nbsp;is not exactly a page-turner. It's rather a quiet journey that demands we slow down, think, and feel before attempting to assimilate higher wisdom, more divine geometry, choreography, and optic theory, and before we meet more of the heroes from the Christian canon, cherishing their divine placement (Look how high Augustine made it. Great to see Joachim of Fiore!, etc.). <b>Lombardo's and Cornish's book, as a book, is engineered to inspire and facilitate this sort of reading</b>, with ample access to the language, ingenuity, creativity and care that Dante summons as he attempted, as far as a poet ever could, to express God's justice and His grace. <b>This is a great classroom text, a tremendously useful parallel-text edition for students, general readers, and anyone at any level studying Dante</b>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Parallel texts serve best in the modern multicultural classroom where multilingual and monolingual speakers alike can directly engage with the majestic text. <b>I have been teaching Dante for 25 years in a historically Hispanic institution and always cherished them because my bilingual students hear the roots of their own linguistic cultures in the Italian and experience both joy and empowerment in doing so</b>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"One should never underestimate how timely and important are the many themes that one encounters in the&nbsp;<i>Paradiso</i>, such as the experiences of the holy women in the early cantos who were forced into marriage and away from their monastic vows, a stunning episode that explores human and particular female agency in shaping one's own personal and spiritual destiny. Also the depictions of equity, equality, and diversity in heaven will be of great interest to modern readers concerned with social order and social justice. <b>What fascinating class discussions can arise from contemplating the medieval and the modern</b>&#x2014;<b>and the divine and earthly</b>&#x2014;<b>urges for justice! Such questions help keep Dante alive and relevant at a time when many teachers fear for the future of the Humanities. To this labor of preserving the past and its great Humanist writers, Lombardo and Cornish have contributed mightily</b>.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lombardo in his Translator's Preface (xxix) says that his translation of the&nbsp;<i>Inferno</i>&nbsp;has been accused of sounding something like the dialogue in a Scorsese movie. <b>And there are in fact some Scorsese-esque moments even here in paradise</b>, such as when Charles Martel lists various illustrious figures born to great destiny during a discussion of how both birth and divine influence play a part in shaping human destiny: "So one is born a Solon, another Xerxes, / one Melchizedek, and another the one / who flew through the air and lost his son" (81: VIII 124-126), lines directly modeled on the Wizard's rundown of human vocational differences to Travis in Scorsese's&nbsp;<i>Taxi Driver</i>.&nbsp;<b>Among a thousand gems, that is, moments when the translation just nails the moment in mood, diction, tone and or register, I would note some favorites: XII.91-94 (p. 119); XII.70-74 (p. 117); and XII.37-39 (p. 95)</b>.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"<b>Cornish's notes to each canto, judicious and hyper-clear</b>, are in the back of the book, supporting undistracted reading. The notes guide and mentor the reader, reinforcing what we just read and providing historical information or identification of figures and concepts. Cornish begins each canto with an overview of the characters and content, and uses key words in the original Italian to introduce major terms and concepts. Her introduction is particularly warm and welcoming, emphasizing the themes of knowledge and most of all love that animate Dante's journey and his relationship with Beatrice. <b>The entire apparatus forged by Cornish breaks down many barriers to reading Dante</b>, in part by directly addressing the traditional preference for the&nbsp;<i>Inferno</i>. One could build a course on Dante out of her economic survey of the liberal arts authors she nimbly weaves into the discussion of cosmology, justice, order, and heaven.<br> After the Introduction a spatial map with an elegant rose and spread sheet of canto, location, class of the blessed, and major characters helps readers to chart their personal journey upward.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"<b>This publication will help ensure that new generations of readers are welcomed into this unique and ineffable journey. I look forward to teaching it as soon as possible</b>."<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2014;Michael Calabrese, California State University, Los Angeles, in <i>The Medieval Review</i><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Integrative Women&#39;s Health (Weil Integrative Medicine Library)</h2><p><em>Integrative Women's Health</em> remains the only in-depth, broad-based reference on integrative women's health written for health professionals. It helps providers address not only women's reproductive health, but also conditions that manifest differently in women than in men, including cardiovascular disease, arthritis, HIV, depression, and cancer. The text presents the best evidence, in a clinically relevant manner, for the safe and effective use of herbs, vitamins, diet, and mind-body strategies alongside conventional medical treatments. As leading educators in integrative medicine, editors Dr. Maizes and Dr. Low Dog demonstrate how clinicians can implement their recommendations in practice, going beyond practical care to examine how to motivate patients, enhance a health history, and understand the spiritual dimensions of healing. In managing the patient, alternative therapies are never seen as substitutes for mainstream medical care, but always "integrated" into the overall regimen, and always subjected to the best available evidence. New to this second edition are chapters on environmental medicine and women's reproduction, thyroid health, and lesbian health.<br></p><p><br>Victoria Maizes, MD is the Executive Director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine and a Professor of Clinical Medicine, Family Community Medicine, and Public Health at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. <br><br>Tieraona Low Dog, MD is the Fellowship Director at the Academy of Integrative Heath &amp; Medicine, and Chair of the US Pharmacopeia Dietary Supplements &amp; Botanicals Admissions Panel in Pecos, New Mexico.<br><br>Featured on <em>Doody's</em> Core Titles List for 2018<p></p><br>"The book is a beautiful synopsis of the medical options available to treat women's body/mind/spirit at all stages of life while incorporating the most current evidence in medicine...

This book provides students who have already taken three or more semesters of calculus with the background to apply statistical principles. Meaty enough to guide a two-semester course, the book touches on both statistics and experimental design, which teaches students various ways &nbsp;to analyze data. It gives computational-minded students a necessary and realistic exposure to identifying data models. <p> </p></p><p>Highly structured, this volume allows those with an established mathematics background to pursue a more rigorous, advanced treatment of probability and statistics.Preface <p> Changes in this third edition have been primarily motivated by our own teaching experiences as well as by the comments of others who use the text. Technology, though, has also dictated certain revisions. The widespread use of statistical software packages has brought certain topics and concepts to the fore, while diminishing the relevance of others. All in all, we feel that this new edition has a sharper focus and that students will find it more accessible and easier to use. </p><p> Many of the major changes come in the middle third of the book, much of which has been rewritten. These are the chapters that make the critical transition from probability to statistics. We have taken a variety of steps to make that material come more alive, ranging from the addition of more helpful examples to the frequent use of computer simulations. </p><p> Chapter 4, for example, now addresses more fully the important question of why certain measurements are modeled by particular probability functions. Relationships that exist between pdfs are given more attention, and the connection between theoretical models and sample data is explored in greater depth. Chapter 5 has been restructured. In the new edition, methods of estimation come first and the underlying theory is taken up last. That arrangement makes it easier for instructors to adjust the amount of time spent on estimation to whatever suits their individual needs. In Chapter 6, the principles of decision-making are now introduced in the context of testing Ho: � = �o rather than Ho: p = po. The result is a more streamlined presentation that avoids the complications inherent in a test statistic whose pdf is discrete. </p><p> Positioned between Chapter 7, which deals with the normal distribution, and Chapters 9 through 14, where the various techniques for analyzing data are introduced, is a new chapter on experimental design. Chapter 8 profiles seven of the most frequently encountered "data models." The basic characteristics of each design are discussed as well as the types of questions each seeks to answer. By providing a framework and a theme, Chapter 8 brings cohesion and a sense of order to the chapters that follow. </p><p> Chapter 11 (Regression) has also been changed substantially. It now begins with curve-fitting, then introduces the linear model, and eventually concludes with the bivariate normal. Regression "diagnostics" have been added to the new edition, and the various inference procedures associated with the linear model have been explained and delineated more carefully. </p><p> Our overriding motivation in deciding which topics to present &#x2013; and in what order &#x2013; stem from our objective to write a book that emphasizes the interrelation between probability theory, mathematical statistics, and data analysis. We believe that integrating all three is vitally important, particularly for those students who take only one statistics course during their college careers. Our experience in the classroom has certainly strengthened our faith in this approach: Students can more clearly see the importance of each of the three when viewed in the context of the other two.</p></p><h2>King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History)</h2><p>This is a historical study of the career of King James VI and I, as king of Scotland (1567-1625) and England (1603-1625), who achieved a union of the crowns as the first king of Great Britain, and who undertook to end the recurring religious wars. His peacemaking by diplomatic means was complemented by his efforts to foster closer relations among the churches. The peace that he helped to maintain by these initiatives, though cut short by the coming of the Thirty Years&#39; War, was immensely beneficial both to Britain and to the other countries of Europe.</p><p>"This is a book...which contributes substantially to the ongoing rehabilitation of the dreamer. ...this is...a book which will define its particular subject for a long time." The Virginia Quarterly Review<br><br>"...weightily documented and authoritative in style, Patterson's study is most convincing of all in its admiration of James...." Church Times<br><br>"Even though the work is scholarly, it is quite readable and would be enjoyable to anyone interested in church history. ...this account of his goals and his dedication in spite of disappointments is somehow quite contemporary. This book can be read as history or as a bridge from the past into the world of today." Charlotte Booth, The Living Church<br><br>"While Patterson's main audience is other scholars of the late Elizabethan, Jacobean, and early Caroline period, his prose is so lucid and his narrative so clear that general readers, if they ignore the footnotes, will enjoy and learn much from this book." Ronald A. Rebholz, The American Oxonian<br><br>"In the era of the 180-page monograph so favored by cost-conscious publishers today, scholars will be grateful to Patterson (and Cambridge University Press) for the comprehensiveness of this work. If at times Patterson seems determined to share every detail he has uncovered, or repeats himself unnecessarily, this is nevertheless a book which will define its particular subject for a long time." Michael F. Graham, The Virginia Quarterly Review<br><br>"This is a substantial and interesting book on James VI and I as religious reconciler and political peacemaker....it is an important addition to the efforts to revise our historical judgement of James's reign....Patterson has written an impressive volume. His sure-footed use of extensive primary sources is very impressive, as is his analysis of James's theories and theology, and the ways in which they shaped the kin's policies and actions. This book is welcome and valuable contribution to the historical rehabilitation of James VI and I as a theologian and statesman." Caroline Litzenberger, West Virginia Shakespeare and Renaissance Association<br><br>"W.B. Pattersons' erudite, interesting, and valuable book contributes to two waves of current historiographical activity." Jerrold Seigel, American Historical Review<br><br>"Patterson's careful scholarship makes this book an important contribution to the study of both theology and diplomacy in seventeenth-century Europe. The book offers thorough discussions of several of the period's thorniest questions of doctrine and international relations. It also fits nicely into recent scholarship on James himself, revising perceptions of him in a more positive direction." Catherine Patterson, Anglican Theological Review<br><br>"This important, scholarly book is the latest contribution to the series, Cambridge Studies in Early Modern History. It should also be noted that the book is written in a style and with a felicity that is admirable." John Booty, Sewanee Theological Review<br><br>"...this work helpfully breaks new ground in understanding key dimensions of James's reign..."

This revealing and innovative book demonstrates that each of us discovers what is true and meaningful, in our lives and in ourselves, through the creation of personal myths. Challenging the traditional view that our personalities are formed by fixed, unchanging characteristics, or by predictable stages through which every individual travels, <i>The Stories We Live By</i> persuasively argues that we <i>are</i> the stories we tell. Informed by extensive scientific research--yet highly readable, engaging, and accessible--the book explores how understanding and revising our personal stories can open up new possibilities for our lives. <br></p><p>Dan P. McAdams, PhD, is Professor of Human Development and Social Policy and Professor of Psychology at Northwestern University, where he is also Director of the Foley Center for the Study of Lives. He has published 12 books and over 100 articles and chapters in the areas of personality and developmental psychology.<br>"There's a quiet revolution taking place within psychology and at its forefront is a young personologist named Dan McAdams. To understand ourselves, he says, you have to go beyond 'objective' data to the myths we create about our lives. Here at last is a book that will introduce you to the revolution, and here is a social scientist--a storyteller, too--who will guide you through the intricacies of your own myths. You'll welcome the chance to spend some time with him." --John Kotre, PhD, Coauthor of<i> Seasons of Life</i>, Professor of Psychology, University of Michigan<br><br>"McAdams looks beyond the narrow confines of academic psychology and sheds light on the mysteries of the life cycle. He calls to his aid the contemporary scientific visionaries Erikson, Jaques, and Levinson, and shows how the life stories we create and revise can lead to genuine self-discovery." --Peter M. Newton, PhD, Professor of Psychology, The Wright Institute, Berkeley, California<br><br>"This wonderful and readable account of the ways in which we use stories across the life cycle and through history provides important new insights into the ways in which we maintain our identity. A compassionate and informed discussion of life-story and life-history, the book will have wide appeal to both students and those working with or studying personality." --Bertram J. Cohler, PhD, William Rainey Harper Professor of Social Sciences in the College and the Departments of Psychology, Psychiatry, and Education, University of Chicago<br><br>"This the first exciting theory of adult personality development as seen through the eyes of the person, and expressed through the ideas each man and woman tells. A 'must' read for those of us entering mid-life and beyond, who seek to better understand where we came from, where we are now, and where we are going." --Robert Emmons, PhD, University of California at Davis<br><br>"Dan McAdams' wonderful book is a major event....McAdams has the gift of being able to express complicated and subtle notions with remarkable clarity." --Robert Hogan, PhD, in <i>Contemporary Psychology</i><br><br>"This is a wonderful book. Dan McAdams integrates the rigor of modern psychology with the humanity, sensitivity, and complexity of the best fiction. His message is simple, yet profound. We are our stories. This work places Dan McAdams in the forefront of psychology's efforts to understand people in their life contexts. It defines a whole new tradition of scientific inquiry." --William Pinsof, PhD, President, The Family Institute at Northwestern University<br><br>"I highly recommend this book for classes in pastoral counseling and religious education. In fresh ways, Dan McAdams introduces us to patterns of human development. Grounded in research, the book provides resources for understanding how people build life meanings.

Members of minority groups strive to make their organizations better for others like themselves without limiting their career paths. Socially or environmentally conscious workers seek to act on their values at firms more concerned with profits than global poverty or pollution.<br><br>Yet many firms leave little room for differences, and people who don't "fit in" conclude that their only option is to assimilate or leave. In <i>Rocking the Boat</i>, Debra E. Meyerson presents an inspiring alternative: building diverse, adaptive, family-friendly, and socially responsible workplaces not through revolution but through walking the tightrope between conformity and rebellion.<br><br>Meyerson shows how these "tempered radicals" work toward transformational ends through incremental means&#x2014;sticking to their values, asserting their agendas, and provoking change without jeopardizing their hard-won careers. Whether it's by resisting quietly, leveraging "small wins," or mobilizing others in legitimate but powerful ways, tempered radicals turn threats to their identities into opportunities to make a positive difference in their companies&#x2014;and in the world.<br><br>Timely and provocative, <i>Rocking the Boat</i> puts self-realization and change within everyone's reach--whether your difference stems from race, gender, sexual orientation, values, beliefs, or social perspective.</p><p><b>Debra E.

Though the majority of the author&#x2019;s work takes place in the parallel reality dimension that contains King&#x2019;s fictional towns Castle Rock, Derry, and others, the parallel reality of Roland the Gunslinger--and by extension that of The Stand--is much more fundamental.<br><br>Just as, in the series itself, The Dark Tower is the point of time, space, and reality where all dimensions meet, the spindle of creation, so are most of King&#x2019;s works then an outcropping of the Dark Tower series, which was conceived as early as 1970. Nearly all of King&#x2019;s heroes and all of his villains, scattered across the various parallel realities, are involved in a single cosmic conflict, with the Tower as the ultimate prize.<br><br>Although Stephen King worked on the Dark Tower series for three decades, consciously and unconsciously weaving it in and out of his other writings, a great many of his readers are likely to have missed its prominence. Just as the Tower itself binds all realities together, this series of stories and concepts is the center of the Stephen King Universe, the many fictional worlds he has created.<br><br>And it all started with a poem.<br><br>King read Robert Browning&#x2019;s &#x201c;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&#x201d; (1855) for a class assignment in his sophomore year (1967/68) at the University of Maine at Orono. In March of 1970, the year he graduated, he began the first novel in the series, The Gunslinger. He continued to work on that novel over the course of the next twelve years, even while he was writing some of his best-loved works, including &#x2018;Salem&#x2019;s Lot (1975), The Shining (1977), and The Stand (1978).<br><br>Did he realize, then, at the start of the process, that it would be all of a piece, all bits of a single story? Perhaps. Perhaps not.<br><br>But it is. In the fourth volume, Wizard and Glass (1997), he at last came to that conclusion. In the afterword, he states:<br><br>I have written enough novels and short stories to fill a solar system of the imagination, but Roland&#x2019;s story is my Jupiter--a planet that dwarfs all the others... I am coming to understand that Roland&#x2019;s world (or worlds) actually contains all the others of my making; there is a place in Mid-World for Randall Flagg, Ralph Roberts, the wandering boys from The Eyes of the Dragon, even Father Callahan, the damned priest from &#x2018;Salem&#x2019;s Lot.<br><br>In the latter volumes, the truth of this collision of worlds becomes incarnate, as characters from &#x2018;Salem&#x2019;s Lot, Hearts in Atlantis, and others all enter into the saga as significant characters, all from different worlds, and as Stephen King himself is drawn into the series as a character, the author a part of his own magnum opus. It is all of a piece.<br><br>Herein, we shall discuss the books in this series and those related to it, how they are interrelated and interconnected, and how they touch upon and are likewise touched upon by other of the author&#x2019;s works.<br><br>The history of the Dark Tower series is this:<br><br>In a place called Mid-World--which might be the future of a world much like our own, or a separate reality entirely--the land is divided into Baronies, some ruled by an honorable rank of men called gunslingers, much like knights. One of the jewels of Mid-world is Gilead, whose lord is Steven Deschain, a gunslinger descended from the bloodline of Arthur Eld, who had united much of Mid-world in ancient times (King Arthur, of course).<br><br>But during Steven&#x2019;s time, a new threat arises. John Farson, called &#x201c;the good man,&#x201c; has begun to incite a rebellion among the peasantry and even some nobility against the Affiliation, the governments of the various Baronies that have banded together. Traitors and spies abound. Marten, a wizard advisor of Steven&#x2019;s, seduces the lord&#x2019;s wife and flaunts that intimacy in front of Steven&#x2019;s son, Roland, a gunslinger-in-training. (In order to become gunslingers, the young students have to best their teacher in battle.) Marten hopes to force Roland to an early test against his teacher so that he will fail, and be killed or banished from Gilead.<br><br>Marten&#x2019;s scheme works, but only partially, for Roland does best his instructor in single combat.<br><br>Roland is shocked to find that his father is aware of Marten&#x2019;s machinations, and Steven prevents him from going after Marten. He tells his son that Marten is working with Farson (though in fact Marten will eventually be revealed to BE Farson), and in order for him to be certain Roland is safe, Steven sends his offspring incognito to a seaside Barony called Mejis, along with his two best friends--Cuthbert and Alain--neither of whom are full gunslingers yet.<br><br>In Mejis, however, they find that Farson&#x2019;s plans have stretched even further, and the local authorities are in league with the rebellion. It is evident that Farson, though pretending to be the hero of the people, has had sinister intentions all along. Soon enough, a dark magician called Walter shows up in Mejis; the mage apparently works for both Farson and Marten. Once again, however, it seems this creature has many faces, and is in fact yet another facet of the same man. Walter is Farson and Farson is Marten, all one and the same. There are many other faces to this being, whom we may alternately refer to as &#x201c;Flagg&#x201d; or &#x201c;Legion.&#x201d;<br><br>Roland falls in love with Susan Delgado in Mejis, and though their love is doomed (as is Susan), it will be the one real love of his life. During his time by the sea, Roland comes into possession of a glass ball, a powerful magical tool that is part of Maerlyn&#x2019;s Rainbow. In it, he sees a vision of the future, much of which he cannot remember later. One thing remains clear to him: the Dark Tower at the center of all things, the spindle upon which reality turns, has been somehow tainted. It is being corrupted, and Roland decides instantly that he must devote his life to a quest to save the Tower.<br><br>Before he may do that, however, he returns to Gilead, where he is tricked by a witch into killing his own mother. The time subsequent to that is shrouded in mystery. All that is known is this: Farson&#x2019;s efforts cause the destruction of the Affiliation and the devastation of Gilead, which only hastens the changes that are coming to the entire world. The world, as Roland says so often, is moving on. It is ending, growing barren and empty. The only way to stop that is to save the Tower, and so Roland and his friends set off on a quest to find it. During that mission, all of his associates, his ka-tet, die, until only he remains.<br><br>Many years later, he catches up with Walter, the man in black, and learns a little about the true nature of the Tower. Thereafter, he begins gathering a new ka-tet from various worlds connected to his own: Eddie and Susannah Dean and Jake Chambers become gunslingers in their own right over the course of the quest.<br><br>The new ka-tet faces many adventures and hardships during their time together. They cross over from one world to another and then back, through thin places between those worlds. In the New York City that Jake is from there is a rose that is the physical embodiment of the Tower before it became tainted. The agents of chaos, or of the Beast that now guards the Tower, the Crimson King, want it destroyed; Roland and the others will have to save it.<br><br>They meet Flagg on their journey, and it is revealed that he is also Marten (Walter/Farson/Legion), who serves the Crimson King. As noted, the specific chronicle of Roland is the centerpiece, but a great many of King&#x2019;s other works have direct or indirect ties to it. Flagg originally appeared in King&#x2019;s landmark novel The Stand, still widely considered to be among his best. In that book, a U.S. military research facility investigating biowarfare accidentally unleashes a virus that kills 99.4% of the population of the Earth. In America, the survivors are plagued with dreams of a kindly old woman serving the side of light, and a dark man with blazing red eyes who serves the cause of darkness. This is Flagg. Over the course of the novel, the survivors join one side or the other, and eventually those serving light must make a final stand against those serving darkness. Flagg is defeated, and society and civilization begin again.<br><br>At the time of The Stand&#x2019;s publication, Flagg&#x2019;s part in Roland&#x2019;s story was unclear. In fact, the next time Flagg appeared as a major figure was in The Eyes of the Dragon (1987). In that fairy-tale-like story, Flagg is a wizard serving a king in a medieval landscape filled with magick, a land that seems somewhat similar to but not necessarily the same as that of Roland the Gunslinger. (Flagg was noted to have returned to that particular city many times over the ages.) The heroes of that tale eventually defeat Flagg but he escapes, prompting two of them, Thomas and Dennis, to go on a hero&#x2019;s quest to destroy the wizard. That is a story as yet untold.<br><br>In the novella &#x201c;The Little Sisters of Eluria,&#x201c; King clearly connects Roland&#x2019;s world with that of The Eyes of the Dragon, unmistakably making them one and the same. In The Dark Tower IV, Roland and his ka-tet pass through a parallel dimension that is clearly that of The Stand, just before they finally meet Flagg face to face.<br><br>A major theme of the Dark Tower series is that due to the machinations of The Crimson King, the &#x201c;beams&#x201d; of power that emanate from the Tower and hold all time, space, and reality together are being broken down and corrupted. This phenomenon has affected all of those realities, causing the barriers between them to begin breaking down and allowing for some travel from one to the next.<br><br>Consider these few examples:</p></p><h2>Soul Communication: Opening Your Spiritual Channels for Success and Fulfillment (Soul Power)</h2><p>Do you want to communicate with your own soul?

In your life, you communicate with your family members. You communicate with your colleagues. You communicate with your friends. In our modern world, we communicate using telephones and the Internet, through radio and television, and via satellites. With advanced technology, scientists communicate with our cells and cell units, and with planets, stars, and galaxies. Communication is a vital part of everyone's life.</p><p>Communication is taking place constantly on Mother Earth, all around us as well as within us. We use countless ways to communicate in our lives. Communication takes place not only among human beings, but also among animals, plants, and insects. Think of the language and intelligence of dolphins, the migration of birds, and the organization of a beehive. Think of how plants respond to the beautiful melodies and harmonies of Mozart. Think of how the DNA and RNA in your cells communicate across generations. All animate things communicate.</p><p>Did you know that inanimate objects communicate also? Everything in the room in which you are reading this book communicates. The company you work for communicates. The car you drive communicates. Mountains and rivers communicate. Mother Earth communicates. They all communicate with each other. This book is communicating with you now.</p><p>You can communicate with all things, animate and inanimate. You can communicate with "things" that do not have physical form, things that are in the spiritual realms or, as I call it, the Soul World. You can do this using <i>soul communication</i>. Through soul communication, you can receive wisdom, knowledge, and healing from any soul in the universe. This book will teach you how.</p><p>Everything has a soul. A human being has a soul. An animal has a soul. A plant has a soul. A flower has a soul. A mountain has a soul. A river has a soul. Do souls communicate with other souls? How do souls communicate? What is the significance of doing soul communication? What are its benefits? How can you open your spiritual channels to do soul communication? I am delighted to reveal the soul wisdom and soul secrets of soul communication to you. This book will answer all of these questions and many more.<i></i></p><p><i>Secrets of Soul Standing</i></p><p>Soul communication is communication between soul and soul. Soul communication is also communication between soul and mind. Why do we need soul communication? We need it because we want to understand our soul's desires and purpose. You have no doubt thought about the purpose of your life. Does a soul have a life purpose? The answer is clear. <i>Yes!</i> A soul has a clear life purpose. Your soul has its life purpose. Every human being's soul has its life purpose.An animal's soul also has its life purpose. Does a plant's or a mountain's soul have a purpose for its life? The answer is clear. <i>Yes!</i> Every soul has a purpose for its own life.</p><p>What is the purpose of a soul's life? <i>Every soul's purpose is to uplift its soul standing</i>. What is soul standing? Let me reveal the soul secrets about soul standing. As human beings, we are in the realm of the universe that has nine layers or levels of souls. This realm is called <i>Jiu Tian</i>, which literally means "the nine heavens." The lowest layer is the ninth one, Level 9. The highest layer is Level 1.</p><p>A newborn soul comes to Mother Earth and floats in nature. It may attach to a rock or a grain of sand. It experiences physical life. These souls are in Level 9. Through many lifetimes, these souls learn and grow through their experiences. They are then ready to be uplifted to a Level 8 or Level 7 soul, which can be the soul of a mountain, a river, a flower, or a forest. At these levels, souls continue to learn from their experiences and offer service to nature and society. The soul will advance to higher layers and reincarnate as an animal. The souls of animals stand in Level 6 or Level 5. These souls continue to serve the universe. They continue to learn their lessons. They continue to improve themselves. As they do all of this, they continue to increase their spiritual standing. When they have done a good job, these animal souls are uplifted to the human being's layer. The soul standing of human beings is Level 4 or Level 3. Human beings uplift their spiritual standing by offering good service, including unconditional love, forgiveness, kindness, compassion, integrity, generosity, and more. When human beings have done an exceptionally good job, the spiritual world will uplift their souls to the saint level. These souls become holy saints, buddhas, Taoist saints, ascended masters, archangels, major gurus, or major lamas. The spiritual standing of these beings is Level 2 or Level 1.</p><p>Each step in the soul's journey from Level 9 to Level 1 could take hundreds of lifetimes. This teaching on soul standing in the universe is the insight received by my spiritual father, Master Zhi Chen Guo, and me. We are honored to reveal these secrets. We are honored to have the opportunity to serve.</p><p>Why do I reveal these soul secrets? I share these secrets so that you can understand the purpose of your soul and of every soul. Now that you know about the layers of soul standing, you may ask, "Why should I care about increasing my soul standing?" Think about history. How many holy saints, healing angels, archangels, ascended masters, buddhas, Taoist saints, lamas, and Indian gurus have served humanity and Mother Earth? Why do they serve unconditionally? Their purpose is in alignment with their souls' purpose: to uplift their soul standing.</p><p>A high-level soul has high-level wisdom, intelligence, knowledge, and abilities to serve. Millions of people know the stories of the Bible. Millions of people know the stories of Buddha. Why are these stories so powerful? They are powerful because the power is given by the Divine and the universe. This power is Soul Power or spiritual power. It is not any other kind of power.</p><p>Every soul in the universe desires to uplift its spiritual standing to be closer to the Divine. Spiritual law states that the higher your spiritual standing, the greater the Soul Power given to you by the Divine. A soul does not wish to increase its standing to satisfy its ego. It wants to increase its standing to gain abilities to serve humanity, Mother Earth, and the universe.</p><p>There is only one way to uplift your soul standing: <i>offer unconditional universal service</i>. Universal service includes universal love, forgiveness, peace, healing, blessing, harmony, and enlightenment. If you offer a little service, you receive a little blessing from the Divine and the universe. If you offer more service, you receive more blessings. If you offer unconditional universal service, you receive unlimited blessings.</p><p>At this time, let us join hearts and souls in a simple practice to offer unconditional service to all of humanity and all souls in the universe. Let us offer service to uplift every soul. We can do this by chanting the mantra Unconditional Universal Service repeatedly. Say:</p><p><i>Dear soul, mind, and body of Unconditional Universal Service, I love you. Can you please offer service to all humanity and all souls in the universe? Uplift their hearts and souls. I am honored and blessed. I cannot thank you enough. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</i></p><p>Then, chant <i>unconditional universal service, unconditional universal service, unconditional universal service, unconditional universal service.</i> Chant repeatedly for at least three minutes, the longer the better. The more you offer service, the more virtue you will gain and the more you will uplift your soul standing. Your life will be blessed tremendously by offering service in this way. The mantra Unconditional Universal Service connects you to the Divine and to all souls so that you can offer them your total love, forgiveness, care, and compassion. This simple soul practice can be done anytime, anywhere, silently or out loud. The only requirement is for you to be sincere and have an open heart.<br></p><p>The soul's journey depends on reincarnation. I personally believe deeply in reincarnation. Reincarnation is one of the most important spiritual laws. We are in the realm of Jiu Tian, the nine layers of Heaven that I briefly explained above. All souls in Jiu Tian reincarnate from lifetime to lifetime as they uplift their soul standing with the goal of reaching Level 1. But Level 1 souls, which are a very high saint level, continue to move their soul standing further. The next step for Level 1 souls is to be uplifted to a realm <i>beyond</i> the nine layers of Heaven. That realm is named Tian Wai Tian, which literally means the "Heaven beyond Heaven." If a Level 1 soul has served humanity, Mother Earth, and the universe very well, Heaven and the Divine can decide to uplift that Level 1 soul to Tian Wai Tian.</p><p>What is the most significant aspect of being uplifted to Tian Wai Tian? <i>Reincarnation stops for a soul in Tian Wai Tian</i>. That soul will stay in Tian Wai Tian, which is the divine realm. That soul will not reincarnate as a human being anymore. That soul will stay in the Soul World forever. That soul will continue to serve humanity and the universe in a special way, because a soul in Tian Wai Tian has much more powerful abilities to serve than a soul in Jiu Tian.</p><p>These are the basic soul secrets about soul standing in Jiu Tian and the possibility of being uplifted to Tian Wai Tian. This is the soul's purpose for all souls in the universe. How can you know where your soul stands? Soul communication is the treasure that can give you the answer to this question and many other questions about your soul journey.</p><p>Soul communication is vital spiritual wisdom for understanding your spiritual journey. It can tell you what your current spiritual standing is. It can tell you about your journey through your past lives, the condition of your soul journey in your present life, and the prospects for your soul journey in your future lives. Physical life is very short.

Yet in Africa, more than 9 million people every year die of hunger, malnutrition, and related diseases every year&#x2014;most of them children. In this powerful investigative narrative, <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporters Kilman &amp; Thurow show exactly how, in the past few decades, Western policies conspired to keep Africa hungry and unable to feed itself. <i>Enough</i> is essential reading on a humanitarian issue of utmost urgency.</p><p><b>Roger Thurow</b> has been a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> foreign correspondent for twenty years.<b> Scott Kilman</b> has been the <i>Journal&#x2018;s</i> leading agriculture reporter. Thurow and Kilman recently won the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award.&#34;How, in a world of plenty, can people be left to starve? We think, &#39;It&#39;s just the way of the world.&#39; But if it is the way of the world, we must overthrow the way of the world. Enough is enough.&#34; Bono &#34;In the twenty-first century, the world has no excuse for tolerating the existence of a billion people going without food. Enough is a passionate and clearly-reasoned call for action to finally end forever the age-old scourge of hunger for any human being.&#34; Muhammad Yunus, winner of the Nobel Peace Price and author of Creating a World Without Poverty &#39;Food is our biggest and most complex industry, and faced with such an elephant, different authors understandably focus on different bits. For a general wrap-up of how we got into this mess and what we need to do about it, you can&#39;t do better than Enough by Roger Thurow and Scott Kilman. This very readable book argues that the agricultural science and technology of the green revolution, which ended famine in much of the world last century, was on the whole a good thing, and that we need more of it.&#39; New Scientist &#39;While grounded in colourful, entertaining reportage, Enough also displays a depth of thought and research more commonly found in academic studies. Well-chosen anecdotes bring the issues to life.&#39; The Financial Times&#34;</p><h2>MURDER IN THE VALLEYS: A cozy Welsh crime mystery full of twists (The Havard and Lambert mysteries)</h2><p><br><b>Ex-superintendent Fabia Havard is struggling with civilian life when a local girl is found dead.</b><br><br>Out walking near the rain-swelled river running past her small Welsh town, <b>she comes across the body of Amber Morgan</b>.

I sent them my r�sum� and an eight-by-ten picture. I wanted it to look punk, so I started coloring the picture with crayons. Danny came by and said, &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; I told him and he said, &#x201c;Nina, there are such things as color Xeroxes.&#x201d;<br> <br>They came out to L.A. and held auditions. I went down in my little MG, dressed all in black. I was dying in the heat, but I had to look cool. A few weeks later, they came out again. This time they wanted me to interview a &#x201c;celebrity.&#x201d; It was Robert Morton, who went on to be Morty, the producer of David Letterman&#x2019;s show&#x2014;he was pretending to be a smart-alecky Billy Joel. It went well, but I didn&#x2019;t hear from them for a while, and I thought that was weird. I&#x2019;m not the cockiest person in the world, but I kept thinking, &#x201c;If they don&#x2019;t hire me, who are they looking for? In the whole United States, how many people are working on this sort of thing already?&#x201d; And I had rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll in my heart.<br> <br>So I called them up, and the phone number went to a hotel, I think the New York Sheraton. I hung up and told Danny, &#x201c;Oh my God, they&#x2019;re a fly-by-night organization using Warner&#x2019;s name. How are they getting away with it?&#x201d;<br> <br>He said, &#x201c;You should call back.&#x201d;<br> <br>It turned out they were the real thing&#x2014;they were working out of a hotel room&#x2014;and they wanted me to come to New York for the final verdict. I went out, and they said, &#x201c;We want you, but you have to move to New York.&#x201d; Because the company&#x2019;s name included &#x201c;satellite communications,&#x201d; I had assumed the job was going to be in L.A.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t decide, so executive producers Sue Steinberg and Robert Morton said they would show me the highlights of New York, hoping I would want to move and take the job. They took me to the public library&#x2014;hey, I like books. And we went to lunch at the Tavern on the Green. I was nervous, and when they brought out the crusty rolls, I inhaled one. It lodged in my throat&#x2014;I was choking to death. Luckily, Morty knew the Heimlich maneuver. He jumped up and saved my life. After everybody calmed down, he said, &#x201c;You owe me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re right. I&#x2019;ll take the job.&#x201d;<br> Mark:<p></p> <br>I got a call from a friend of mine in Philadelphia. We both knew a guy named Richard Bencivengo, and he said, &#x201c;I heard that Bencivengo&#x2019;s working on some sort of music video channel.&#x201d; I was unhappy at WPLJ, so I called them up. It turned out they were seeing everybody in the world. A bunch of people from PLJ went in&#x2014;I saw them at the auditions. The first audition was in a forty-eight-degree studio. It was pitch-black, with a stool and a spotlight. Freezing cold, with a spotlight in the face, the vibe was interrogation: Answer our questions or we&#x2019;re going to pluck out your eyeballs. I talked into the camera about Eric Clapton going on tour. There was a one-way window in the studio; it felt like a sci-fi movie where they do an experiment and the alien overlords watch through the window, waiting to see if your head explodes.<br> <br>It was a few weeks before I heard anything&#x2014;I guess they were scouting for talent in other cities. I had a second audition, at a different, warmer studio. They had two areas set up. One had a big white card with pictures of the Eagles taped on it, perched on an easel. They wanted me to back-announce an Eagles video, and then walk from the board to this other area, which had a ratty couch and a chair, sit down there, and throw to the next video. They were literally seeing if I could walk and talk at the same time.<br> <br>There were a couple of camera guys, and a bunch of producers, and cue cards. I had never worked with cue cards before, but I knew what I was supposed to be saying. At one point, I was so far off the cards, the producer had no idea what to hold up next. I just said, &#x201c;Next card, please.&#x201d; I found out later that went a long way toward getting me the job&#x2014;when I needed some information, I didn&#x2019;t stumble through it like a standard TV host. I spoke to the people off-camera and asked for it.<br> <br>The next section was interviewing &#x201c;Billy Joel,&#x201d; as played by Robert Morton. Billy Joel is the nicest guy ever, but Robert was being cantankerous, giving yes and no answers to questions. At the end, I talked to Sue Steinberg. I&#x2019;m six foot one, and Sue is approximately four foot nine. She looked up at me and said, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ll be hearing from us.&#x201d; There was something in her face that said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you this, but you so have this job.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nina was the first one they hired, and then maybe a day later, J. J. I got the call very soon after that. I had a three-year contract with ABC, which owned WPLJ, but I really wanted to do MTV. I booked a vacation, went away for ten days, and let my lawyers hash it out.<br> Nina:<p></p> <br>They wanted me right away&#x2014;this was the middle of June. I asked if I could stay in L.A. for the Fourth of July. At the time, there were wonderful fireworks up and down the coast, and I really wanted to see them. I watched them from my favorite spot, Topanga Beach, and left for New York City on July 5.<br> <br>MTV was a gamble. Vicki Light, who was my agent, and Danny, who was my manager, figured it was some little cable show, and if I didn&#x2019;t like it, I could come back in three months. We weren&#x2019;t even sure it&#x2019;d still be on the air six months later.<br> <br>MTV put me up in a beautiful hotel, the Berkshire. After the incident at the Tavern on the Green, I was really scared about choking when I was by myself. For about two months, I would order room service and eat right next to the phone so I could call the front desk in case anything happened.<br> <br>The first weekend I lived in New York, I had maybe one friend outside of the people at MTV&#x2014;and I didn&#x2019;t really know them either. Mark kindly said, &#x201c;You want to go to Central Park?&#x201d; I got into a cab to meet him and immediately got into a car accident. Not a big one, but there was lots of screaming and yelling. After I finally made it to Central Park, Mark and I were walking around when a bush came alive.<br> Mark:<p></p> <br>There was some commotion in the bush, and I said, &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s probably rats fighting. No big deal. There must be some garbage there.&#x201d; Nina completely freaked out. She was so not a New York person. I thought Nina was really hot, and I was definitely attracted to her, but I was in love with Carol, so I didn&#x2019;t try to instigate anything between us&#x2014;and today, we&#x2019;re like brother and sister.<br> <br>After a format change at KWST&#x2014;it went from classic rock to top 40&#x2014;J. J. was without a job. At his MTV audition, he also interviewed &#x201c;Billy Joel&#x201d;&#x2014;and did well, despite not caring for the actual Billy Joel. When the producers told him that the job meant moving to New York City, he said, &#x201c;You see that beautiful black Jensen Interceptor sitting out there? You see those mountains, that blue sky, those big, puffy clouds? All that goes away if I go to Manhattan. But I&#x2019;ll go, &#x2019;cause I need the gig.&#x201d;<br> Nina:<p></p> <br>I met J. J. in the lobby of the Berkshire, where MTV had put us both up. He commanded your respect immediately, but he was a very sweet man. We were both Angelenos, so we talked about the sports cars that we had left behind. I had an MG; he had a Jensen Interceptor, which was a hand-built British car. He always pronounced it &#x201c;Intacepta.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t so much of a Boston accent as it was a J. J. accent. MTV gave the two of us tickets to see Judas Priest. Our seats were right in front of the speakers, so we lasted maybe thirty seconds and then went out to dinner.<br> <br>MTV had hired one other VJ, Meg Griffin. I knew she was an FM jock, and I thought she was really cool. I didn&#x2019;t get a chance to talk to her very much, because she quit almost immediately.<br> Mark:<p></p> <br>Meg had been at WNEW-FM for years, and was next in a long line of jocks who were being groomed for a full-time spot. She was great&#x2014;I was happy she got the MTV job. Meg was a very cute all-American girl next door, bangs and freckles, a Martha Quinn type. One day, before we launched, Meg did an interview with the Equators. At the end, Meg was supposed to get up: They would play some Equators music and she would dance with the band. For some reason, they had to do a few takes, and she was really uncomfortable with the whole thing. In her mind, that sealed the deal. We shared a cab uptown together after we were done for the day, and she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to quit.&#x201d;<br> <br>I told her, &#x201c;Meg, don&#x2019;t do this. You will regret this. Do not leave&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll work this out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Later, she told me there were other factors: Bob Pittman, who ran MTV, didn&#x2019;t want her to keep a part-time job at WNEW. He said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to work harder if this is your only job.&#x201d; He wanted her to have the fear that comes with no backup plan. That was Pittman&#x2014;he always wanted to keep his foot on our necks.<br> <br>Meg was at MTV for the same reason I was&#x2014;she was passionate about music. It became clear to her that wasn&#x2019;t why they hired her: Do they want me here because I love music, or because I look like whole wheat? So she quit, and got that full-time position at WNEW. That was what made room for Martha.<br> Martha:<p></p> <br>Even though I&#x2019;d graduated from NYU, I kept my desk clerk gig at Weinstein. (Some clerks stayed there for years&#x2014;the most famous being Ric Menello, who wound up directing videos for the Beastie Boys.) One afternoon in July, I was sitting on the city bus, heading back uptown to my weird apartment. Around Rockefeller Center, the traffic got really bad. The bus wasn&#x2019;t moving, so I jumped off to visit my friends at WNBC. Purely by chance, a guy named Burt Stein was also visiting. He used to work for A&amp;M Records in California, and he was hanging out at WNBC that day for no particular reason. A bunch of us were shooting the breeze in the music office. Then Burt randomly asked, &#x201c;Hey, what&#x2019;s Bob Pittman doing?&#x201d; Bob had been the youngest-ever program director of WNBC&#x2014;he left before I got there, but he was a legend.<br> <br>Buzz Brindle, assistant program director at WNBC, and a former professor of mine, said, &#x201c;Oh, he&#x2019;s doing this MTV thing.&#x201d; And then Buzz looked at me and uttered the words that changed my life forever: &#x201c;Martha, that&#x2019;s what you should do. You should be a VJ on MTV.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a VJ?&#x201d; I practically scoffed.<br> <br>Buzz said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a DJ on the radio, but on television.&#x201d;<br> <br>This sounded like WKRP in Cincinnati to me, so I asked the logical question, &#x201c;What do I during the records?&#x201d; I was thinking they&#x2019;d film a DJ studio.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s videos,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re playing these clips.&#x201d;<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;Oh, I can&#x2019;t do that. You know who should do that? Evan Davies, he&#x2019;s really good at music.&#x201d; Evan was another radio major from NYU.<br> <br>Buzz said, &#x201c;No, I really think you should do it.&#x201d; He picked up the phone and called Bob Pittman. It turned out it was the last day of auditions. Buzz said, &#x201c;You gotta get down there&#x2014;they&#x2019;re closing up shop at five-thirty.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was already 5 P.M., and I didn&#x2019;t know how I would get to Thirty-third Street and Tenth Avenue in time. I knew I&#x2019;d never get a cab, so I called my friend Adam, the only person I knew who had a car. Adam picked me up, dropped me off on Thirty-third Street, and went to get a pizza. I walked into the studio and said, &#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m here to audition.&#x201d; And they were like, &#x201c;Uh, who are you?&#x201d;<br> Nina:<p></p> <br>As I was running out the door, in came this young woman, barely five feet tall. As I remember it, she had a flower hat, and a T-shirt that said I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC. I thought, &#x201c;Hmmm, not very rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll.&#x201d; Not being judgmental&#x2014;I just didn&#x2019;t think she was what they were looking for.<br> Martha:<p></p> <br>I was in the outfit that I&#x2019;d put on that day to go work at Weinstein&#x2014;I was dressed for sorting mail and handing out toilet paper. I had a T-shirt with an iron-on glitter transfer that said, of all things, COUNTRY MUSIC IS IN MY BLOOD. My junior-year roommate (not the Wilhelmina model&#x2014;this one left school when she got pregnant and married a Bible salesman) gave it to me. And I was in a white tennis skirt and Keds. Not one speck of makeup. I didn&#x2019;t even have a brush for my hair.<br> <br>After they figured out that I was supposed to audition, they sat me in a barber chair in front of a camera. I read the teleprompter for a bit, and then they said, &#x201c;Okay, now tell us about a concert that you&#x2019;ve been to.&#x201d; I talked about an Earth, Wind &amp; Fire show at Madison Square Garden. I had no idea what was at stake&#x2014;if I did, I probably would have been too jittery to get the job! The audition was literally three minutes, but by the time it was over, I had a pretty good idea of what this MTV thing was about and I really wanted the gig. I called my brother and said, &#x201c;I auditioned for something that is perfect for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>A couple of days later, after getting my hair cut at the Plaza&#x2014;courtesy of Jane Bryant Quinn&#x2014;I checked my messages from the corner of Sixth Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street. That was back when you had to access your answering machine with a little beeper. There was a message: Sue Steinberg saying, &#x201c;Come to the studio, we think we have good news.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hailed a cab right away. When I got to the studio, I was escorted upstairs to a conference room with executive producers Sue Steinberg and Julian Goldberg. They asked, &#x201c;So how would you like to have a job where you fly around the country and interview rock stars and go to concerts and be on TV?&#x201d;<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll take it.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t even ask, &#x201c;How much?&#x201d; I was twenty-two years old.<br> Mark:<p></p> <br>We were doing run-throughs, practicing as we led up to the channel&#x2019;s debut on August 1. Martha and Alan joined very late, in mid-July. I watched Martha and thought, &#x201c;Who is this kid? She has no idea what she&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d; Neither did I, but I did know music. It was clear to me that they were desperate as we got closer to the launch: They wanted five VJs, and they didn&#x2019;t have them.<br> Alan:<p></p> <br>In the summer of 1981, I went to a &#x201c;Way Up North in Mississippi&#x201d; picnic in Central Park, an event for anybody born, bred, or educated in the state of Mississippi. There were hundreds of people at the picnic, eating watermelon, spitting seeds, doing the barbecue thing. They even&#x2014;oh, Lord&#x2014;sang &#x201c;Dixie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bob Pittman showed up in a jacket, snazzily dressed for a hot summer day in New York City. I was wearing some grungy shorts. Bob&#x2019;s father was friends with my father-in-law; they were both Methodist ministers. So I was introduced to Bob; I didn&#x2019;t know a damn thing about him except he was big in radio. I told him I was a struggling actor, bartending at night, going to auditions, trying to catch a ride somewhere. He told me he was working on a new cable channel for Warner AmEx: music video, twenty-four hours a day. &#x201c;Really? I was just in this David Bowie video.&#x201d; I told him about &#x201c;Fashion.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how spinning videos twenty-four hours a day would work, but I was polite about it. Bob was a nice guy, but aloof. A very cool cucumber.<br> <br>Two weeks later, I got a phone call from Sue Steinberg. I don&#x2019;t know how she got my phone number, but she said, &#x201c;Bob bumped into you at the park and thinks you should audition for this thing we got going, called The Music Channel.&#x201d;<br> <br>I went to the audition totally blind. I had to read some teleprompter copy, no problem. I was a good cold read...</p><h2>Your Keys, Our Home.</h2><p>If you&#x2019;ve ever dreamed of casting off your worldly possessions and traveling to your heart&#x2019;s content, this story about two intrepid seniors will inspire you no matter your age.

The theatrical poses and objects in the portraits are based on well-known images of powerful figures drawn from seventeenth- through nineteenth-century Western art. Pictorially, Wiley gives the authority of those historical sitters to his twenty-first-century subjects.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;National Portrait Gallery&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;My intention is to craft a world picture that isn&#x2019;t involved in political correctives or visions of utopia. It&#x2019;s more of a perpetual play with the language of desire and power.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kehinde Wiley<br><br>&#x201c;Wiley inserts black males into a painting tradition that has typically omitted them or relegated them to peripheral positions. At the same time, he critiques contemporary portrayals of black masculinity itself.... He systematically takes a &#x2018;pedestrian&#x2019; encounter with African-American men, elevates it to heroic scale, and reveals&#x2014;through subtle formal alterations&#x2014;that postures of power can sometimes be seen as just that, a pose.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Art in America<br><br>Los Angeles native and New York-based visual artist Kehinde Wiley has firmly situated himself within art history&#x2019;s portrait painting tradition. As a contemporary descendent of a long line of portraitists&#x2014;including Reynolds, Gainsborough, Titian, Ingres, and others&#x2014;Wiley engages the signs and visual rhetoric of the heroic, powerful, majestic, and sublime in his representation of urban black and brown men found throughout the world. By applying the visual vocabulary and conventions of glorification, wealth, prestige, and history to subject matter drawn from the urban fabric, Wiley makes his subjects and their stylistic references juxtaposed inversions of each other, imbuing his images with ambiguity and provocative perplexity.<br><br>In <b><i>Black Light</i></b>, his first monograph, Wiley&#x2019;s larger-than-life figures disturb and interrupt tropes of portrait painting, often blurring the boundaries between traditional and contemporary modes of representation and the critical portrayal of masculinity and physicality as it pertains to the view of black and brown young men. The models are dressed in their everyday clothing, most of which is based on far-reaching Western ideals of style, and are asked to assume poses found in paintings or sculptures representative of the history of their surroundings. This juxtaposition of the &#x201c;old&#x201d; inherited by the &#x201c;new&#x201d;&#x2014;who often have no visual inheritance of which to speak&#x2014;immediately provides a discourse that is at once visceral and cerebral in scope.<br><br>Without shying away from the socio-political histories relevant to the subjects, Wiley&#x2019;s heroic images exhibit a unique modern style that awakens complex issues which many would prefer remain mute.</p><p><b>Kehinde Wiley</b>&nbsp;received his MFA from Yale University in 2001. Shortly after, he became an artist-in-residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem. He is represented by Deitch Projects, New York, Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago, and Roberts and Tilton, Los Angeles.

Excerpts from 'identity cards' that are part of the Museum's exhibit focus on specific young people whose worlds were turned upside down when they became trapped under Nazi rule. Many of these young people never had the chance to grow up. One and a half million of the victims were children and teenagers--the great majority of them Jewish children but also tens of thousands of Roma (Gypsy) children, disabled children, and Polish Catholic children. Like their parents, they were singled out not for anything they had done, but simply because the Nazis considered them inferior.<br><br>Those who survived to become adults passed on the stories of relatives and friends who had been killed, with the hope that the terrible crimes of the Holocaust would never be forgotten or repeated. The powerful stories and images in this book are presented with the same hope. Only by learning about the Holocaust will we be able to tell the victims we remember. <br></p><p><b>Susan D. Bachrach</b> is a staff historian in the Exhibitions Department at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. She received her Ph.D. in modern European history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She lives with her husband and their two children in Washington, D.C.Gr. 5-9. One and a half million children and teenagers were murdered by the Nazis. This photo-history, produced in association with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, focuses on what happened to young people whose world of family and friends, school and play, was destroyed. More than 30 short, accessible chapters cover the general history, including the rise of Hitler, the ghettos, the transports, the camps, the gas chambers, and the movements of resistance and rescue. Sidebars tell the ongoing stories of individual young people and show their ID photos; some of the individuals are pictured several times during the period 1933-45, but many don't survive. The writing is direct, with no histrionics or gimmicks. A wealth of material drawn from the museum's large collection of photographs and taped oral and video histories supports the facts. The systematic murder is confronted here. We're told of the brutality, the medical experiments, and the corpses stacked up like cordwood, and there are pictures of the death marches and the gas chambers. The Jews were the main target of Nazi hatred, but throughout the book, Bachrach also talks about other groups and individualsincluding Gypsies, homosexuals, and the disabledwho were marked as enemies of the state. The book's design is clear, with a spacious chronology at the back, a long bibliography, subdivided by genre and reading level, and an appendix of population figures by country. This is one of the best books available for introducing the subject to young people and an excellent text for the Holocaust curriculum now required in many states. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>The First Fruits of Prayer: A Forty-Day Journal through the Canon of St. Andrew</h2><p><p>Join Frederica Mathewes-Green on a guided retreat through an ancient Orthodox text. Regardless of your denominational background, First Fruits of Prayer will bring to life the prayer experience of first millennium Christianity through immersion in this poetic hymn, an extraordinarily beautiful work that is still chanted by Christians around the world each Lent. It weaves together Old and New Testament Scriptures with prayers of hope and repentance and offers ancient ways of seeing Christ that still feel new today. </p><p>&#x201c;Fascinating and sometimes magisterial....

She has been interviewed in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>,<i> Newsweek,</i> and <i>Time</i>, among other publications, and is the author of eight books, including <i>The Illumined Heart: Capture the Vibrant Faith of Early Christians</i>, and<i> The Open Door: Entering the Sanctuary of Icons and Prayers</i>. Visit her at www.fredrica.com</p>In this fascinating and sometimes magisterial guided exploration of an eighth-century hymn that is central to Lenten religious practice for the Eastern Orthodox, Mathewes-Green encourages her readers not only to examine but also to personally apply fundamental Christian concepts like repenting, understanding the nature of sin and experiencing God in prayer. A skilled interpreter of the theology and history of the Orthodox tradition, Mathewes-Green arranges the Great Canon of St. Andrew, bishop of Crete, into 40 readings accompanied by scriptural references, commentary, theological reflection and questions. Mathewes-Green, who has clearly done her scholarly homework, sets the stage by giving a brief overview of Andrew's life and an abbreviated paraphrase of the life of St. Mary of Egypt. (This account of a female hermit's meeting with a monk on a Lenten retreat is also read during the service of the Great Canon. This gem from the early church is alone worth the price of the book.) While some readers may be put off by Mathewes-Green's apparent conviction that her denomination has preserved the soul of the early church while Western Christians have strayed, others will find her insights both evocative and provocative. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Destiny shares a telepathic connection with Nicolae, her mentor. But now Nicolae needs to find her, or he may lose his soul and succumb to darkness forever.</p><p><p>Christine Feehan has had more than forty novels published, including four series which have hit #1 on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list. She is pleased to have made it onto numerous other bestseller lists as well, including <em>Publishers Weekly</em>, <em>USA Today</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, BookScan, B. Dalton, Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Waldenbooks, Ingram, Borders, Rhapsody Book Club, and Walmart. In addition to being a nominee for the Romance Writers of America&#x2019;s RITA Award, she has received many honors throughout her career, including a Career Achievement Award from <em>Romantic Times</em> and the Borders 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>Prolific Feehan (<i>Dark Melody</i>, etc.) continues her supernatural Dark series with this 13th installment, the first to feature a female Carpathian. Though Carpathians roam the streets at night and gain strength from feeding on blood, they only kill evildoers and vampires. Transformed into a night creature when she was a child, Destiny is unlike any of Feehan's previous heroines. Her physical strength is equal to that of her Carpathian counterpart, Nicolae Von Shrieder, but she's horrified by what she is and haunted by memories of her parents' brutal murder. Nicolae merged his mind with hers when she was first transformed, and through their mental connection, he taught her how to survive. Now Nicolae must find Destiny and make her his lifemate, or he will succumb to darkness and become a vampire. Feehan's protagonists and prose can be overwrought ("His body was hard and full, aching for her.... and deep within, the crouching beast lifted its head and roared for release"), and inconsistencies litter the text (Destiny can supposedly read Nicolae's mind, but it takes her eons to trust him and stop threatening to kill him). However, the story has sufficient sensuality to keep readers sated, and fans should appreciate Feehan's unusual pairing of two Carpathians. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, in this fun, practical book, she helps readers radically shift their relationships with food and find more life-affirming ways to care for themselves. With an exhilarating combination of intelligence and wicked good humor, she offers bite-sized pieces of invaluable wisdom.</p><p>Geneen Roth estimates that she's gained and lost more than 1,000 pounds during her life. That makes her uniquely qualified to write this, her sixth book, which delivers exactly what its subtitle indicates: <i>50 Ways to Feel Thin, Gorgeous, and Happy (When You Feel Anything But)</i>. It's sure to appeal to her considerable cult of readers who've bought her other feel-good, anti-diet books including the bestselling <i>When Food Is Love: Exploring the Relationship Between Eating and Intimacy</i> and <i>Why Weight?: A Guide to Ending Compulsive Eating</i>. It's for the estimated 25 million women in America alone who are on diets; for those who find that they're never happy because they delay gratification ("I'll be happy when I lose 10 pounds"), and those who punish themselves for eating one too many chocolate chip cookies. <p> Roth's advice is simple, but often beyond the realm of thinking of someone obsessed with calorie counting. She recommends that you eat at least one hot meal every day, as a slice of hot pizza will make you feel more full than a cold and cardboardy one will; that you should do one "exquisitely kind" thing for yourself every day, be it buying new underwear or taking a sledgehammer to your scale; and that you should "separate the desire to be thin from the desire to be cherished." She also gives straight diet advice that can't be found in publications along the lines of <i>Cosmo</i>: "<i>Too much</i> fat makes you fat. But <i>too little</i> makes you fat, too, because you usually make up for eating nonfat foods by eating twice as much. I suggest you allow yourself to eat enough fat to feel full. Part of the reason that many of us feel as if we could start eating at one end of our kitchens and chomp our way clear across the United States is that we never give ourselves permission to feel full without feeling guilty, to eat enough fat when it's not on a binge." Amen. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p>Why is feeling fat as common among size four women as among size sixteen's? Why should you carry a chunk of chocolate everywhere? What is the "suffering contest", and why is losing it so important? <i>When You Eat at the Refrigerator, Pull Up a Chair</i> is bestselling author Geneen Roth's witty tell-all about the secret ways we sabotage ourselves every day, as well as an inspired book on how we can learn to live, love and celebrate life no matter what. Roth, known for her pioneering books on women, food and losing weight without dieting--The New York Times bestseller <i>When Food is Love</i>, as well as <i>Feeding the Hungry Heart</i>, <i>Appetites, Breaking Free from Compulsive Eating</i> and <i>Why Weight?</i>--has been teaching workshops nationwide for twenty years to dispel the myths and undo the damage of diets and deprivation. Her work has been featured on "Oprah," "20/20," "NBC Nightly News," and "Good Morning America." Over the years, her students have asked her to create a book--something small enough to be slipped into a purse or pocket--to help remind them that true nourishment can be found in unexpected--and non-caloric--places. With its creative arsenal of techniques, <i>When You Eat at the Refrigerator, Pull Up a Chair</i> helps readers successfully find their way to a better understanding of life's bumps and bruises, and teaches them how to bring beauty, power and joy back into their lives without paying for it in unwanted pounds or bills. Roth proposes a radical shift in our thinking about what being "thin" really is and what it allows us to be and feel. <p>She has seen time and again with her tens of thousands of students that being thin doesn't automatically lead to happiness (shocking as this may be!), and that there are direct, effective and practical ways to feel joy, strength, power and value daily. In this new book, Roth teaches how to find contentment without conditions ("I'll be happy when I lost those ten pounds, find the right job, have the perfect house...."), and how to stop waiting for your life to begin. With advice ranging from the physical to the metaphysical, she teaches how to put insight into action, figure out what you're really up to in your life, as well as providing a simplified approach to eating--guidelines that actually lead to weight loss without dieting. </p><p>Among its fifty succinct chapters are:<br> * Three Ways to Stop a Fat-and-Ugly Attack<br> * Retail Therapy is as Important as the Other Kind<br> * Whenever You Feel Fat or Worthless, Ask Yourself Whose Instructions You are Following<br> * Eat Enough Fat<br> * Do Not Sneak Food or Feelings<br> * Be Willing to Lose the Suffering Contest<br> * When You are Not Hungry, Beauty is Better than Bonbons<br> </p><p>By turns practical, whimsical, and spiritual, <i>When You Eat at the Refrigerator, Pull Up a Chair</i> sends a clear message: Stop waiting for the day when you are finally thin enough, good-looking or buff-enough, smart or smartly-dressed enough, and start living now! Frank and funny, it transforms the way we perceive not only food, but the entire way we live our lives.</p></p><h2>Media Relations Handbook for Government, Associations, Nonprofits, and Elected Officials, 2e</h2><p><p><em>Media Relations Handbook for Government, Associations, Nonprofits, and Elected Officials, 2e</em>, by Bradford Fitch, Editor: Jack Holt.

You cannot not-communicate nor can you un-communicate. For an individual entity, there is only ONE communication. Not multiple, not varieties, only one. That one communication is the culmination of all that has been communicated by the entity until the "now" in time. You cannot go back and un-communicate something. You can only begin from the "now" to create the intended outcome. That outcome is always a negotiation with the receiver/audience/community to cultivate an agreed understanding.</p> <p>For a communication professional, understanding this fact is essential. No matter where you work, someone has been communicating something before you began. You cannot un-communicate it. You cannot create a new beginning; but you can begin now to create a new outcome.

Kali is fierce. Meaning, when you use her mantra you are invoking a fierce energy. Her energy is not subtle.The results can be rather dramatic, Kali, the dark mother of the Hindu pantheon is oft the most misunderstood Goddess in all human spiritual endeavor. Her images often depict her as being an evil and demonic force that few should ever dare call upon whilst others worship her as benign Goddess whom bestows blessings upon her supplicants. She is , in fact, both of these . Kali will challenge the stuffiness and properness you have acquired in this life. She will challenge who you think you are. She will spit in your face, she will push your buttons and will humble you. She will make you face your demons. Cut away your pride. She will make you grow whether you feel you&#39;re ready or not. All for the sake of breaking you out of your shell, a shell you so readily hide in. Kali will throw you into your challenges raw. Thus, letting you learn on your own. She would be the one to push you into the deep end of the pool so you can learn to swim.

But, as Graham Phillips shows through a wealth of literary and scientific evidence, King Arthur was a real man, Camelot a real place, and the legendary Excalibur a real sword--and Phillips has located them all. <br> <br>Phillips examines the earliest stories of Arthur as well as previously unknown ancient manuscripts preserved in the vaults of the British Library in London, such as the work of the 9th-century monk Nennius, to pinpoint the exact locations of Arthur&#x2019;s tomb, the ruins of Camelot, and the sword Excalibur. He reveals the mythic king as the real-life leader Owain Ddantgwyn, who united the British to repel invasion from Germany around 500 AD. Moving his quest from library vaults to the real sites of Arthur&#x2019;s life, the author confirms his research through a Dark Age monument, hidden away in the mountains of western Britain, that bears an inscription about a powerful warlord who went by the battle title &#x201c;Arthur.&#x201d; He visits archaeological excavations at the ruins of Viroconium, near Wroxeter in Shropshire, clearly identifying the ancient city as Camelot, the fortified capital of Arthur&#x2019;s Britain. Working with specialist divers and marine archaeologists, he surveys the depths of an ancient lake in the English countryside to reveal the resting place of Excalibur. Enlisting a team of scientists and sophisticated geophysics equipment, he uncovers the lost grave of the historical King Arthur, buried with his shield, just as told in legend. <br> <br>The culmination of 25 years of research, including new translations of primary source material, this book provides the necessary evidence to allow King Arthur to finally be accepted as the authentic British king he was.</p><p>A former radio journalist and broadcaster for the BBC, Graham Phillips is a historical investigator and author of 13 books, including <i>The Templars and the Ark of the Covenant</i>, <i>Merlin and the Discovery of Avalon</i> <i>in the New World</i>, <i>The Chalice of Magdalene</i>, and <i>The End of Eden</i>.

Born in Muslim Spain, he has become famous in the West as the greatest mystical thinker of Islamic civilization. He was a great philosopher, theologian, and poet.<br><br>William Chittick takes a major step toward exposing the breadth and depth of Ibn al-'Arabi's vision. The book offers his view of spiritual perfection and explains his theology, ontology, epistemology, hermeneutics, and soteriology. The clear language, unencumbered by methodological jargon, makes it accessible to those familiar with other spiritual traditions, while its scholarly precision will appeal to specialists.<br><br>Beginning with a survey of Ibn al-'Arabi's major teachings, the book gradually introduces the most important facets of his thought, devoting attention to definitions of his basic terminology. His teachings are illustrated with many translated passages introducing readers to fascinating byways of spiritual life that would not ordinarily be encountered in an account of a thinker's ideas. Ibn al-'Arabi is allowed to describe in detail the visionary world from which his knowledge derives and to express his teachings in his own words.<br><br>More than 600 passages from his major work, al-Futuhat al-Makkivva, are translated here, practically for the first time. These alone provide twice the text of the Fusus al-hikam. The exhaustive indexes make the work an invaluable reference tool for research in Sufism and Islamic thought in general.</p><p><p>William Chittick is a Professor of Religious Studies at State University of New York, Stony Brook. He is author of The Sufi Path of Love: The Spiritual Teachings of Rumi and nine other books.</p>&#34;For the first time in the history of Orientalism, a thorough study of Ibn al-&#39;Arabi&#39;s thought is now available. William Chittick has given us a translation of numerous passages from the work of the Magister Magnus and placed them in their theological context, thus removing many misunderstandings that have prevailed both among Muslims and in the West when interpreting Ibn al-&#39;Arabi&#39;s mystical worldview. Chittick has done this with admirable clarity, and his book will always remain a most important milestone in the study of Islamic mystical theology.&#34; -- Annemarie Schimmel, Harvard University</p><h2>We All Fall Down</h2><p>They entered the house at 9:02 P.M. and trashed their way through the Cape Cod cottage.

His many books include&nbsp;<i>The Chocolate War</i>,&nbsp;<i>I Am the Cheese</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fade</i>,&nbsp;<i>Tenderness</i>,&nbsp;<i>After the First Death</i>,&nbsp;<i>Heroes</i>,&nbsp;<i>Frenchtown Summer</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Rag and Bone Shop</i>. In 1991 he received the Margaret A. Edwards Award, honoring his lifetime contribution to writing for teens.Grade 8 Up-- After the benignities of his last novel, Other Bells for Us To Ring (Delacorte, 1990), Cormier returns to the gritty form that made him famous. His new novel is sure, accordingly, to inflame the same parental passions and excite the same critical controversies that visited the publication of The Chocolate War (1974) and After the First Death (1979, both Pantheon). It is also sure--like those books--to find a devoted following among the kids themselves, who will recognize and embrace the authenticity of the achingly awful adolescent world that Cormier has created. It is a world in which emotions are raw, evil exists, and violence--both studied and offhand--is an everyday occurrence. The book begins, in fact, with overt violence--the trashing of a suburban house by a group of teenage boys--and ends with a more subtle kind of violence--the trashing of love and the destruction of hope. If this looks like familiar territory, look again. Cormier is gingerly exploring some new terrain here, both literally (by moving his setting from the familiar confines of Monument to the neighboring community of Burnside) and figuratively (by counterbalancing the emotional aridity of evil with a genuinely moving and nurturing love story). More familiar territory is a suspenseful subplot involving a character called "The Avenger," whose goal is to exact revenge for the trashing. Although it certainly will keep readers turning the pages, this may be the weaker part of the novel, particularly its resolution, which seems somewhat glib. Other considerations, however, of character, setting, and the complexity of family interrelationships are richly realized. And the overriding thematic treatment of the dialectics between good and evil and free will vs. predestination is sure to stimulate discussion and vigorous dialectic of its own. --Michael Cart, Beverly Hills Public Library<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hard To Dance With the Devil On Your Back</h2><p>In every culture and time, persons of faith, of all ages, have summoned trials and tribulations to find the endurance and strength to &#x201c;dance.&#x201d; They have danced with the weight of the world upon their shoulders, sustained by God and others dancing near them.<br> <br> <em>Hard to Dance&nbsp;With the&nbsp;Devil On Your Back</em> is&nbsp;a seven-session Lenten study that looks at the&nbsp;transcendent struggle in the lives of believers, while helping us to enter the continually crumbling world surrounding Jesus and the disciples in the days preceding Easter.<br> <br> Appropriate for both group and individual use, the study provides one session for each week in Lent.

Trese (1902-1970): &#x201c;Christ&#x2019;s whole life was one of concern for others,&#x201d; wrote Leo Trese - and this humble priest dedicated his own life to showing that same concern. Through more than forty years of priestly ministry, Leo Trese poured himself out for Christ&#x2019;s flock and wrote numerous clear, spiritually rich books to inform, inspire, and encourage Christians worldwide. Born in Port Huron, Michigan, Leo Trese was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Detroit in 1927 and served as associate and as pastor at various parishes in Michigan. Concern for the least fortunate marked his priestly ministry from the beginning, moving him to make time to serve as chaplain at an assisted-living residence for women and as chaplain for a school. In 1936 he was named the first pastor of St. Christopher Church in Marysville, Michigan, as well as of the Mexican Center in Port Huron, Michigan. He was so dedicated to his pastoral work that he received permission to spend a brief period in El Paso, Texas, in order to study Spanish so he could better serve the Mexican population in Michigan. <p>In the 1940s, Fr. Trese began receiving so many requests for spiritual guidance that he started to write spiritual books to provide direction in the most comprehensive and straightforward manner possible. His writing quickly grew from a hobby that he pursued in his spare time to an apostolate that consumed most of his energies. Soon he was receiving numerous requests to give retreats and radio talks. </p><p>By 1953 the demand for his writings had become so great that Fr. Trese became concerned that writing was interfering with his care for his parishioners. He still wrote only to fulfill specific requests, but those requests had multiplied tremendously. &#x201c;Maybe it is God&#x2019;s will,&#x201d; he told Detroit&#x2019;s Archbishop, Edward Cardinal Mooney. &#x201c;If I say no, I may be refusing Him the little talent He has given me.&#x201d; As a loyal son of the Church, he asked Cardinal Mooney to decide whether he could better serve as a priest by ceasing to write or by being relieved of some of his pastoral duties. Recognizing the value of Fr. Trese&#x2019;s writing, the diocese granted him several leaves so that he could devote his time solely to spiritual writing. </p><p>In addition to articles for magazines such as Ave Maria, Fr. Trese wrote numerous books on spirituality, apologetics, the priesthood, and even child psychology. Among his best works are A Man Approved, Vessel of Clay, You Are Called to Greatness, Many Are One, Book for Boys, Parent and Child, and his enduringly popular The Faith Explained. Demand for his writings has never abated: his works have spread throughout the world and have been translated into Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Korean. Suffused with clarity, warm humor, and simple, down-to-earth examples, Fr. Trese&#x2019;s books continue to help today&#x2019;s readers to know and love the Catholic Faith, and to inspire them to live it out in all circumstances.</p><p><b>Terry Barber, St. Joseph Communications</b><br>"An inspiring book for souls who want to go to Heaven."</p> <p><b>Russell Shaw, Editor, Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Catholic Doctrine</b><br>"Straightforward and full of the accumulated wisdom of the Catholic tradition.

I think we''ve got to cut ourselves out to be whatever we want to be.<br><br> -- Frank Bettger<br><br>When it comes to the importance of sales professionals in today''s marketplace, Red Motley sums it up best: "Nothing happens until somebody sells something."<br><br>That may seem like a bold statement, but look at it this way: Would the driver for an international freight company have a job if somebody hadn''t sold the products being delivered? Would the construction worker have a job if a site developer hadn''t sold the City Council on the idea of a retail store? Would the aerospace engineer have a job if an account executive hadn''t secured a new contract for commercial jets?<br><br>Those are just a few examples of how powerful the sales professional''s role is in driving the world economy. You could say the same thing about virtually any business. In fact, next time you see a truck on the highway, drive past a construction site, or board an airplane, you can smile and think to yourself: "All of this activity around me is happening because of what I do."<br><br>To us, that''s exciting. Salespeople are leaders. They truly make things happen. In the minds of customers, they are the face of the company. And those who succeed in building strong business relationships are often paid very well for their efforts.<br><br>Despite the impressive rewards that await top sales performers in most industries, many salespeople don''t reach their full potential. Why? Because they don''t understand the fundamental process of buying and selling.<br><br>Think about the game of golf: A lot of people play, but very few really know how. We can even draw the same comparison when it comes to photography. Most of us can take pictures, but not many of us have the knowledge or skills to become a published photographer.<br><br>Selling is the same way. A lot of people know just enough about selling to make a decent living. But most people don''t know enough about the buying and selling process to truly excel in a sales career.<br><br>That''s where the Sales Advantage comes in.<br><br>If you''ve been selling for many years, perhaps by instinct rather than structure, this book can help you realize why you''re succeeding. At the same time, it shows you what you''re not doing -- or doing unnecessarily -- that''s keeping you from achieving your full potential. If you''re new to sales, this will give you an essential foundation upon which to build a successful and lucrative sales career.<br><br>We''ll share numerous tools that can enhance your relationship with the customer. Will we use all of these tools in every sales discussion? Absolutely not. Every selling situation is different.<br><br>Keep in mind that selling is not about manipulating people into buying. It''s about creating an atmosphere that''s conducive to customers making a favorable decision for everyone involved. After all, nobody likes to be sold. But we all like to make good buying decisions. That is why our philosophy for selling is one of Dale Carnegie''s most quoted human relations principles:<br><br><b>Sales Philosophy</b><br>"Try honestly to see things from the other person''s point of view."<br><br>Sounds like common sense doesn''t it? But common sense is not always common practice. It is often very difficult for salespeople to see things from a buyer''s perspective. We often don''t know their internal policies, politics, challenges, and processes. Many salespeople do not actually use the products and services they sell. In fact, many of the people who influence the buying decision don''t use them either. Purchasing agents are a good example. So, it is critical for us to really understand the perspectives of everyone who has a role in buying.<br><br>This philosophy improves the customer''s trust, enhances your reputation, and builds solid customer relationships. Selling according to this philosophy, in conjunction with your personal selling style, will energize you. It will significantly enhance your results and help you feel proud about being a sales professional.<br><br>fs20<br><br>Most salespeople who are successful ultimately realize that selling is a process. A proven process will give us predictable results. The process outlined below has been proven and can help any salesperson improve results.<br><br><b>The Sales Process</b><br><br>1. New Opportunity<br><br>2. Pre-approach<br><br>3. Initial Communication<br><br>4. Interview<br><br>5. Opportunity Analysis<br><br>6. Solution Development<br><br>7. Solution Presentation<br><br>8. Customer Evaluation<br><br>9. Negotiation<br><br>10. Commitment<br><br>11. Follow-up<br><br>Successful salespeople tell us that one of the keys to their performance is to follow a repeatable, proven process that gets consistent, positive results. The process outlined here has been tested extensively in a wide variety of products, industries, and cultures. It works. Adjust and adapt the process for your business and you can see the results.<br><br>The first three elements of the sales process represent every activity that leads up to that all-important first meeting. We must identify the new opportunity, do our homework through pre-approach, and initiate communication with the prospect before gaining an interview. These are essential activities in the sales process, and they take place in almost every selling situation. If we don''t do these activities effectively, we haven''t really earned the right to take our prospect''s time.<br><br>Once we get into the interview, we must know how to build rapport and find out specifically what people need and want. As simple as that sounds, many salespeople don''t understand their customers'' true issues. Why? They don''t know how to ask the right questions.<br><br>When they interview customers, they only ask surface-level questions. Consequently, most salespeople don''t uncover the primary interest areas and the Dominant Buying Motive (the emotional reason people buy). These two key pieces of information are critical to developing a truly unique solution that stands apart from the competition.<br><br>While the interview is the heart and soul of the sales process, there are many things we have to do after that meeting in order to develop solid customer relationships. So beyond the interview, the selling process represents the activities necessary to turn our prospects into customers. We develop the solution, present it to our prospects, help them evaluate it, gain commitment, and follow up to ensure satisfaction. This part of the sales process is when we truly demonstrate our ability to step into our customers'' worlds. We see things from their point of view and provide solutions that no other salesperson can provide.<br><br>Which part of the process is most important? All of them. Look at it this way: If we can''t get the discussion started, how can we present a solution? If we get the first meeting but don''t gather information effectively, how can we be sure we''ve offered the right solution? If we gain commitment but don''t follow up, what are the chances of repeat business? Clearly, if any piece of the process fails, the relationship can collapse. Does every sale go through these phases? Not necessarily. But most of them do. In fact, selling is often repetitive and, in many cases, very predictable.<br><br><b>SOME ELEMENTS OVERLAP</b><br><br>We''ll find that many elements of the sales process overlap into more than one part of the sales discussion. For example, it''s likely that we will use effective questioning techniques several times in our interaction with the customer. And in virtually every part of the process, we''ll find Dale Carnegie''s human relations principles to be a critical element in our success.<br><br><b>THE PROCESS IS PREDICTABLE,<br><br>BUT THE SITUATION ISN''T</b><br><br>If we''re selling in an industrial environment with long sales cycles, the pre-approach may take place over several weeks. Not only that, we may have several interviews with a customer before we actually present a solution. On the other hand, in retail situations, there''s very little -- if any -- pre-approach work that can be done. And, in contrast to large equipment sales, we may never have contact with the same customer again beyond the initial meeting.<br><br>The point is, we need to recognize that each selling situation is unique. Some salespeople will go through each element of the process several times a day. Others may only go through them a few times a year. The key is to understand how the eleven parts apply in your unique situation, and 0 then act accordingly.<br><br><b>UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE PROCESS <br>IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS</b><br><br>Mastering one or two skills alone won''t generate the same results as understanding and mastering the entire sales process. Even though we want to practice them one step at a time, the power of the Sales Advantage is fully realized when we pull them all together.<br><br>Let''s say we''re stranded on a deserted island. The good news: There''s an old airplane on the island that actually flies. The bad news: We have no idea where we are, and no map to help us reach our final destination. Even though we have tools available to get off the island, we don''t know where to go once we get in the air. If we decide to leave, we merely fly on chance and hope for the best. We may eventually get home; we may not.<br><br>The same theory applies to selling. Understanding and applying the principles of the entire buying and selling process leaves nothing to chance. Just as we wouldn''t fly an airplane without a flight plan, we shouldn''t try to sell without developing a sales strategy that encompasses every relevant part of the sales process.<br><br>Kevin McCloskey, sales representative with Quantum EDP in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, talks about how applying the Sales Advantage principles makes a difference in his selling strategy.<br><br>"I had been in sales for three years and never had a template to follow when approaching potential clients," said Kevin. "This unorganized approach quite often left me tongue-tied and unable to communicate effectively to the client what my services are.<br><br>"Now that I understand selling as a process, I am able to understand the customer''s true requirements and expectations and then communicate effectively the value-added service I can offer. As a result, my success ratio has increased considerably. I feel I can now control and understand the sales cycle, which inevitably makes me a better, more professional salesperson."<br><br>McCloskey''s success speaks for itself: Only six weeks into practicing the Sales Advantage principles, his activity increased so dramatically he had to hire an assistant.<br><br>Jack Maloy, northeast district manager with Tetra in Blacksburg, Virginia, says that applying the sales process and relieving "the pressure" on the customer enabled him to get significant additional shelf space for his company''s products. He also says he created a new kind of excitement in a family-owned retail account.<br><br>"Treasure Island Aquarium and Pet Center is a family-run business that has three locations. Over time, I had slowly gained their trust in regards to the pet business, but had not had any luck in getting them to implement Tetra''s full ''Nutrition System.'' The customer has always been very cautious in reviewing new products and programs. So I realized that if I continued to ask for the sale on each visit, I might risk losing his trust.<br><br>"So instead of thinking about closing, I decided to review the entire sales process. I started by making an unannounced visit to one location, just to stop by and say hello and see how things were going. No selling involved. I began to ask probing questions, knowing the customer''s answer would most likely be positive.<br><br>"Because I was listening and was truly interested in his opinion, the customer then became interested in what I had to say, especially in how he could increase sales with current customers. I then provided him with the ''solution'': our full Nutrition System. He had a few objections. But, because I was following the steps of a logical buying process, I was prepared for them and we quickly overcame them. I was able to secure his commitment. Both Treasure Island and Tetra will benefit from this partnership."<br><br>Entrepreneur Bruce Hughes, vice president of Repro Tech, Inc., in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, believes learning the sales process has taught him how to "overcome anything."<br><br>"After leaving corporate America, I decided to purchase part ownership in Repro Tech, Inc. Besides me, there was one employee at the time -- my business partner Deborah Bruss. Her expertise was administrative and mine was service and repair. Neither of us had any previous sales experience. Needless to say, I didn''t know that selling had a process to it.<br><br>"Since we had very few customers, along with bills to pay and families to support, I needed to have a customer base. How did I plan on getting customers? You got it -- cold calling.<br><br>"For the next six months, I experienced something I never had in the past: rejection. As we all know, rejection is part of selling, but at that time, I was not prepared for this new experience. I got to the point where I thought something was wrong with me. I started to fear knocking on doors or picking up the telephone to make appointments. But I kept at it. I kept saying to myself, ''There has got to be a better way.''<br><br>"Then, I came across the Sales Advantage. I learned that with proper training and attitude, I could become a very successful salesperson. I began to implement the process. Soon, I started seeing less and less rejection. Learning and understanding the sales process taught me how to overcome any objection, from the initial cold call all the way to getting the order signed.<br><br>"Our company continues to grow. We now have several employees and we serve many counties in the area. I have achieved goals that were once only a dream. I do not fear rejection or objections, but often welcome them. I still cold call every day, but now I enjoy it. I have the greatest job in the world. I love being a salesperson!"<br><br>Kevin, Jack, and Bruce are just three people out of thousands who have seen a significant boost in their sales results after they began applying the timeless fundamentals of the Sales Advantage.<br><br>Here''s the bottom line: Learning and applying the right skills can increase your activity level, decrease your stress level, help you develop stronger customer relationships, and put more money in your pocket. Anybody who really understands how to sell will tell you the same thing.<br><br>While the sales environment has changed, the buyer''s mind goes through the same process it always has. Nobody''s going to buy anything unless he or she has a reason to buy. And when that reason becomes significant, we need to be there ready to provide solutions that meet that person''s unique needs and wants.<br><br><b>The Sales Advantage: A Big Impact on Big Challenges</b><br><br>Our tools and principles have specific applications when it comes to the toughest challenges faced by today''s sales professionals.

Its effects remain the nation's most pressing business. Trouble in Mind is an absolutely essential account of its dreadful history and calamitous legacy."&nbsp;&nbsp;--The Washington Post<br><br>"The most complete and moving account we have had of what the victims of the Jim Crow South suffered and somehow endured."<br>--C. Vann Woodward<br><br>In April 1899, black laborer Sam Hose killed his white boss in self-defense. Wrongly accused of raping the man's wife, Hose was mutilated, stabbed, and burned alive in front of 2,000 cheering whites. His body was sold piecemeal to souvenir seekers; an Atlanta grocery displayed his knuckles in its front window for a week.<br><br>With the same narrative skill he brought to the Pulitzer Prize-winning Been in the Storm So Long, Leon Litwack constructs a searing history of life under Jim Crow. Drawing on new documentation and first-person accounts by blacks and whites, he describes the injustices--both institutional and personal--inflicted against a people. Here, too, are the black men and women whose activism, literature, and music preserved the genius of their human spirit. Painstakingly researched, important, and timely, Trouble in Mind recalls the bloodiest and most repressive period in the history of race relations in the United States--and the painful record of discrimination that haunts us to this day.<br><br>"Moving, elegant, earthy and pointed. . . . It forces us to reckon with the tragic legacies of freedom as well as of slavery. And it reminds us of the resilience and creativity of the human spirit." <br>--Steven Hahn, The San Diego Union-Tribune<br><br>"A chilling reminder of how simple it has been for Americans to delude themselves about the power of race."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --The Raleigh News &amp; Observer</p><p>The name of the era, "Jim Crow," was somehow derived from an old minstrel song, but there was nothing frivolous about the laws and traditions used to keep blacks from participating in society in the post-Reconstruction South. Leon Litwack, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a noted authority on black history, has written a searing account of the age of Jim Crow in <i>Trouble In Mind</i>. The book is arranged in thematic chapters that show how blacks were restricted at every turn. Blacks were kept in perpetual debt, denied proper schooling, and were subjected to daily assaults on their dignity. Most disturbing was the institution of lynchings, the thousands of hangings and burnings that terrorized blacks in the South. Litwack documents how lynchings were carefully planned and attracted large crowds who viewed them as cathartic entertainment. <i>Trouble In Mind</i> deals with a long and sad chapter in American History, but Professor Litwack has written a laudable book which deserves to be read. <i>Trouble In Mind</i> is considered a sequel to Litwack's <i>Been In the Storm So Long</i>, a critically acclaimed account of Reconstruction which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History."This is the most complete and moving account we have had of what the victims of the Jim Crow South suffered and somehow endured."<br>--C.

Sara lives in lives in Newcastle upon Tyne in the North of England.A purple rhino moves in and the adults are oblivious. What's a kid to do?Daisy's parents never listen to her anyway. So when she tries to point out to Mom and Dad that a huge, purple rhinoceros is strolling into the kitchen, chomping a pancake, and heading upstairs, they mishear and dismiss her. The creature makes himself at home. He hangs out in the yard; he keeps Daisy company while she dons her roller skates; he even sits on the toilet. Steadfast Daisy, unalarmed, decides that since her parents are too busy to pay attention to her, she'll talk to the rhino instead. They become fast friends. Ogilvie uses pencil, pastel, ink, paint, monoprint, and digital tools to create lighthearted illustrations full of loose lines, enlivening the matter-of-fact, sometimes-bland text. Fanciful colors, overlaps of media, and colorings-in that escape their outlines make for a 1970s vibe. Humor and sadness blend: the rhino's single tear is poignant as he expresses his longing to go home ("a million miles away"), but Daisy's possible solutions include a hot air balloon and a bicycle, rejected because "the helmet would never fit." Only outside proof of the rhino's existence conquers Daisy's parents' denial, and the text dulls as Daisy reconnects with them, but the last page upticks in wit. Amusing and whimsical. Author: Kirkus Reviews Source: March 1, 2015<br><br>Daisy&#x2019;s parents are awfully busy. So busy, in fact, that they don&#x2019;t notice the huge purple rhino that tromps into their kitchen, snaps up a pancake, and makes himself at home. Nor do they pay attention when Daisy tries to tell them there&#x2019;s a huge rhino in their house. Luckily for Daisy, Rhino is not busy at all and he <i>loves </i>to listen. When her parents finally wonder about the missing pancakes, and Daisy tells them about her pachyderm pal, they hoot with laughter and take her to the zoo to show her a real rhino. Only, the zoo&#x2019;s rhino, who happens to be purple and loves pancakes, is missing. A quick trip home reveals the truth, and Daisy and her sheepish parents help the rhino get back to Africa. Ogilvie&#x2019;s loose, sketchy illustrations, full of loopy streaks of colored pencil and pastel in a saturated palette, are charmingly childlike and add to the droll atmosphere. As much a cautionary tale for parents as a giddy yarn for kiddos, this will make for an entertaining read-aloud. Author: Booklist Source: April 15, 2015<br><br>In this agreeably chatty book, little Daisy is eating pancakes when a big purple rhino &#x201c;strolled into the kitchen. That&#x2019;s right, a big purple rhino!&#x201d; Daisy&#x2019;s parents cut her off each time she tries to tell them about the rhino, who nonchalantly wanders around the house, even using the toilet (Daisy closes the bathroom door for him). Her parents eventually listen long enough to realize what Daisy is saying, but they still don&#x2019;t believe her, so they take her to the zoo to show her what a real rhinoceros looks like&#x2014;and end up surprised themselves. Ogilvie&#x2019;s illustrations use a variety of media&#x2014;pastels, paint, ink, and more&#x2014;in an informal style that matches the tone of the casual text. The bright colors spill out of their lines, lines are sometimes scribbly or jagged, and the people all have perpetually startled wide eyes. Visual humor plays into every picture, such as Daisy&#x2019;s parents sitting perched on the end of the sofa that the rhino earlier sat on (and broke). Most of the elements are familiar, from the unexpected visitor to the oblivious parents, but the humor is on target for the pre-K to third grade set, and it&#x2019;s got great read-aloud potential for groups or at home.

The gospel is proclaimed, but for it to be received as a gift depends on whether the hearer is in a position to do so. Offered here are thirty-one of Pastor Bonhoeffer's sermons, in new English translations, which he preached at various times of the year and in a variety of different settings. Each is introduced by Bonhoeffer translator Isabel Best, who also provides a brief biography of Bonhoeffer. The foreword is by Victoria J. Barnett, general editor of the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, English edition, published by Fortress Press, from which these sermons are selected. <p>In his preaching, Bonhoeffer's strong, personal faith the foundation for everything he did shines in the darkness of Hitler's Third Reich and in the churches' struggle against it. Though not overtly political, Bonhoeffer' s deep concern for the developments in his world is revealed in his sermons as he seeks to draw the listener into conversation with the promises and claims of the gospel a conversation readers today are invited to join.</p></p><p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906 1945) was a German pastor and theologian whose striking theological journey and public witness against the Nazi regime led to worldwide fame after his death in 1945.<p>Isabel Best has contributed translations to a number of volumes in the English language series of Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works published by Fortress Press, including Letters and Papers from Prison, Vol. 8 (2009), Berlin: 1932-1933, Vol. 12 (2009), London, 1933" 1935, Vol. 13 (2007), and Ecumenical, Academic, and Pastoral Work: 1931" 1932, Vol. 11 (2012).

And as with any good music book, you find yourself wanting to discover more about a band whose music has largely defied categorisation."-- Irish Independent"Excellent.

Dixon is the author of the ever-popular Hardy Boys books.Peril at Granite Peak GOING DOWNHILL<p></p> 1<p></p> FRANK<p></p> <br>HEADS UP, FRANK!&#x201d; JOE SHOUTED. &#x201c;Coming through!&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced up from adjusting my boot buckle. My ski helmet made it hard to see. But my brother was impossible to miss in his red-and-blue jacket and tricked-out mirrored goggles. He bent low over his skis, poles tucked tightly under his arms and a big grin on his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Learn to steer or you&#x2019;ll be back on the bunny slope, hotshot!&#x201d; I yelled with a laugh as he whizzed past me.<br> <br>Then I looked over my shoulder to check on our friend Chet Morton. Chet was the reason Joe and I were in Vermont, but that didn&#x2019;t mean he was an expert skier. Not even close. My eyes widened as Chet&#x2019;s skis almost crossed while he was negotiating an easy turn. He lurched and started to fall, but somehow righted himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice save, buddy!&#x201d; I called helpfully.<br> <br>Chet turned his head and squinted at me. It looked like his goggles were crooked. He was picking up speed as he slid downhill.<br> <br>Just ahead, Joe had executed a crisp stop and was looking back as well. &#x201c;Look out, Chet!&#x201d; he hollered. &#x201c;Tree!&#x201d;<br> <br>Chet whipped his head around just in time to see the huge spruce hurtling at him. Well, technically he was hurtling at it. Whatever. The effect would be the same if the two collided.<br> <br>&#x201c;Turn! Turn!&#x201d; Joe and I yelled at the same time.<br> <br>Chet leaned hard to the left, missing the tree by inches. Whew! He lost his balance immediately after that, belly flopping into a large snowdrift.<br> <br>&#x201c;Close one,&#x201d; Joe called.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I frowned, tilting my head as I heard a weird rumble. &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Then I saw my answer. The snowdrift Chet had hit was moving.<br> <br>&#x201c;Avalanche!&#x201d; Joe shouted. &#x201c;Get out of the way, bro!&#x201d;<br> <br>He pushed off, aiming straight down the slope. I did the same. Glancing back over my shoulder, I saw Chet scrambling to his feet on the uphill side of the moving mass of tumbling snow. Good. He was safe. Joe and me? Not so much.<br> <br>There was a snow-covered pile of rocks just ahead so I bent low, leaning into a tidy parallel turn to avoid it. I looked over, expecting Joe to follow. But he was still heading straight down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look out!&#x201d; I yelled.<br> <br>Too late. Joe was headed straight for the rocks! And the avalanche was coming fast. If he wiped out, he&#x2019;d be buried!<br> <br>I held my breath as Joe reached the rock pile. He saw it a half second before he got there and bent a little lower, letting gravity take him up and over on its thin covering of snow. A second later he was airborne. One ski started to dip down, and for a second I was sure he was going to wipe out. But he recovered quickly, landing hard but squarely and then turning sharply to follow me out of the path of the avalanche.<br> <br>Joe was breathing hard when he caught up to me at the base of the slope. &#x201c;Nice skiing, brother,&#x201d; he said, lifting his fist.<br> <br>I bumped it, then pushed back my goggles. &#x201c;Nice jump,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That was a little too close for comfort.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Chet?&#x201d; Joe peered up the slope. The avalanche was over, and we saw Chet carefully snowplowing his way down the hill.<br> <br>By the time he reached us, my hands had almost stopped shaking. &#x201c;Are you guys okay?&#x201d; Chet cried. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to do that!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Forget it,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re fine. It&#x2019;s just lucky nobody else was on the trail when it happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chet nodded. &#x201c;Yeah. This place is even deader than Cody said it would be.&#x201d;<br> <br>There were maybe three or four skiers visible on the various hills within our view, plus half a dozen beginners on the bunny slope over near the lodge. Other than that, we had the mountain to ourselves.<br> <br>Joe was already heading for the lift. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s try the White Rattlesnake Trail next. Cody was telling us about it at breakfast, remember? It sounds like fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t answer for a second. The White Rattlesnake did sound like fun. Maybe a little too much fun for Chet. If he&#x2019;d caused an avalanche on the relatively easy green circle trail we&#x2019;d just negotiated, what would he do on a trickier slope?<br> <br>But Chet wasn&#x2019;t saying anything, so I didn&#x2019;t either. Joe and I might be brothers, but that didn&#x2019;t mean we always saw things the same way. He was definitely the daredevil type. Me? I liked a little adrenaline rush as much as the next guy&#x2014;as long as that next guy wasn&#x2019;t Joe. He already thought I was way too cautious. I didn&#x2019;t want to give him more ammunition. Besides, Chet was a big boy. If he didn&#x2019;t want to try the White Rattlesnake Trail, he could speak up and say so.<br> <br>We were a dozen yards from the lift when we heard a bark. Glancing over, I saw a guy hurrying past, head down and hands shoved into the pockets of his well-worn parka. A large black-and-tan dog was at his side. Her ears were pricked toward us, and her furry tail was wagging.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cody!&#x201d; Chet called, waving. &#x201c;Yo, over here!&#x201d;<br> <br>Cody Gallagher was the one who&#x2019;d invited us to Granite Peak Lodge. He&#x2019;d been Chet&#x2019;s camp counselor years ago, and the two of them had kept in touch. Cody was a few years older than us, tall and wiry with reddish-brown hair. A little quiet, but a nice guy. He&#x2019;d graduated from high school a year or two earlier and now worked full-time at the lodge with his parents. His trusty Lab-shepherd mix, Blizzard, never left his side.<br> <br>Cody heard Chet and looked over. He was pretty far away, but for a split second it looked as if a shadow passed over his expression. Was I imagining things, or did he appear less than thrilled to see us?<br> <br>But the moment passed quickly. &#x201c;Hi, guys,&#x201d; Cody said, coming over. &#x201c;Having fun?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A blast,&#x201d; Joe replied, leaning over to rub Blizzard&#x2019;s furry head.<br> <br>I nodded. &#x201c;But listen, there was a minor avalanche on the Sugar Maple Trail just now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I quickly filled him in on what had happened.<br> <br>Cody listened, looking concerned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let my parents know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They might want to add that slope to the restricted list until we can check it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded again. There was a notice hanging on the bulletin board in the lodge&#x2019;s dining room, listing several ski trails that were off-limits due to weather conditions or other issues. I&#x2019;d had plenty of time to study it that morning while Joe and Chet were having a third helping of bacon and eggs.<br> <br>&#x201c;So where are you going?&#x201d; Chet asked Cody as we neared the ski lift. &#x201c;Hoping to get a few runs in?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; Cody said. &#x201c;Mom asked me to clear some branches off one of the trails.&#x201d;<br> <br>There were only a few people waiting for the lifts. As we arrived, a young couple hopped into an empty car. Cody grabbed a well-worn pair of skis and poles that were leaning against the wall of the control booth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess we won&#x2019;t have to wait long for a lift,&#x201d; Joe joked as two more skiers stepped into another lift.<br> <br>Cody grimaced. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shot Joe a warning look. Leave it to my brother to bring up a sore subject. We all knew that Granite Peak Lodge was having trouble attracting enough visitors&#x2014;that was the main reason we were there. A couple of bigger, flashier resorts had opened on the other side of the mountain recently, and people were flocking to them. According to Cody&#x2019;s dad, the skiing was better on this side of the mountain, but people liked the Wi-Fi and spa treatments and fancy gourmet food those other resorts offered.<br> <br>That was why Cody had e-mailed Chet a few weeks ago, urging him to come for a stay over winter break and bring all his friends. He&#x2019;d even sent a discount coupon for one of the lodge&#x2019;s nicest suites.<br> <br>Chet had been all for it. Surprisingly, so had his parents. Or maybe not so surprisingly. They were going to a wedding out of state, and I guess they preferred to ship Chet out to the lodge rather than leave him home alone.<br> <br>However, Joe and I were the only friends Chet could convince to tag along. I guess nobody else&#x2019;s parents liked the idea of a bunch of teen guys let loose at a ski resort.<br> <br>That hadn&#x2019;t been a problem for us, though. Mom and Dad had okayed the plan as soon as they heard about it. And I was pretty sure I knew why. See, Joe and I had this hobby&#x2014;solving crimes. We&#x2019;d been doing it since we were little kids. And we were good at it. We&#x2019;d nabbed more than our share of bad guys, sometimes with the help of our dad, a retired police detective and private investigator. Dad didn&#x2019;t always approve of our tendency to put ourselves in danger, but he&#x2019;d been mostly supportive of our sleuthing. He got it, you know?<br> <br>But lately we&#x2019;d run into some trouble. Legal trouble, mostly. Not to mention some bad feelings with the local police. Long story short, we&#x2019;d had to promise to get out of the crime-solving business for good, or we&#x2019;d end up in reform school.<br> <br>After we&#x2019;d helped bust a local crime ring called the Red Arrow, though, Bayport&#x2019;s police chief (and our parents) relaxed the rules, telling us we could catch a few crooks now and then as long as we agreed to keep law enforcement in the loop. Still, we were trying to keep a low profile in the crime-solving department. Truth be told, I think our parents were hoping that getting us out of Bayport for a week or two might keep our minds off mysteries for a while.<br> <br>And I figured they were right. What kind of trouble could we find up here?<br> <br>Soon we were at the front of the line. The lifts only held two people apiece.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; I told Chet as an empty car swung toward us. &#x201c;Joe and I will catch the next one.&#x201d;<br> <br>My brother and I watched as Chet and Cody headed up the mountain. A moment later we hopped onto the next lift, our skis swinging as the car rose into the crisp, cold winter air.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is awesome.&#x201d; Joe scanned the scenery. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;ve got this whole place to ourselves, pretty much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, you might want to stop mentioning that in front of Cody,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Especially after that weather forecast this morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>Joe&#x2019;s face fell. &#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Do you think we&#x2019;ll have to leave?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged. The weather report was warning that a serious blizzard might be coming in the next forty-eight hours. For a while they&#x2019;d thought it would skirt the area, but now it seemed to be aiming right at Granite Peak. Then again, there was still a slight chance it would all peter out. I supposed that was why my aunt Trudy called them &#x201c;weather guessers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not much we can do about the weather,&#x201d; I told Joe. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just have fun and see what happens. We can make a decision tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chet and Cody were waiting when we arrived at the top. The lift dropped us off at the edge of a large, flat clearing near the top of the hill. Several trails started there, snaking off in different directions, with large wooden signs marking the start of each one. The signs included the trail&#x2019;s name, difficulty level, and a map showing its place on the mountain. A trio of twentysomething girls who&#x2019;d been just ahead of us in the lift line were starting out down a black diamond trail, while a man dressed in a flashy red-and-white parka was standing nearby, adjusting his helmet and goggles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Great day for skiing, huh?&#x201d; I said as I passed him.<br> <br>The man turned and blinked at me through his goggles. He was in his early thirties, with pasty skin, thin brown hair poking out from under his helmet, and watery gray eyes. He turned away without bothering to respond.<br> <br>Whatever. I shrugged and moved on.<br> <br>&#x201c;White Rattlesnake, here we come!&#x201d; Joe exclaimed, using his poles to push himself along in the direction of the trailhead.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hang on, I think my buckle&#x2019;s loose.&#x201d; Chet knelt down and fiddled with one of his boots.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have fun, you guys,&#x201d; Cody said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll catch you at dinner.&#x201d; He headed toward one of the trailheads with Blizzard at his heels.<br> <br>While we waited for Chet, I watched the pasty-skinned man head across the clearing. He wasn&#x2019;t exactly an expert skier. He almost tripped over his poles, then got his skis crossed and almost went down. I was a little surprised he wasn&#x2019;t still taking lessons down on the bunny slope.<br> <br>As he reached one of the signs, I glanced at it. Good. It was a green circle trail&#x2014;the easiest level.<br> <br>But my eyes widened when I took in the name on the sign: Whispering Pine Trail.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait! No!&#x201d; I yelled as the man pushed off and disappeared down the slope. I spun around and gestured to the others. &#x201c;We have to stop him!&#x201d;</p><h2>Forbidden Science 4: The Spring Hill Chronicles, The Journals of Jacques Vallee 1990-1999 (4)</h2><p><p>A FASCINATING INTELLECTUAL ODYSSEY</p><p>The Spring Hill Chronicles are a record of Jacques Vallee&#x2019;s private study into unexplained phenomena between 1990 and the end of the millennium, during which he was traveling around the globe pursuing his professional work as a high-technology investor.</p><p>This fourth volume of <em>Forbidden Science</em> takes the reader behind the scenes: to the board room of the National Institute of Discovery Science; to meetings with congressmen and intelligence officials; and to the closed sessions of the Rockefeller Initiative.

There was much trial and error and many failed ideas around creating a new alphabet, with many of the concepts proposed facing strong criticism and outright rejection by the public. It was not until long after Franklin&#x2019;s death that Webster finally publish his first ever Compendious Dictionary of the English Language. The combination of bold illustrations, humorous anecdotes, and fabulous storytelling makes this true tale anything but boring. It provides a much-needed introduction to the art of spelling and dictionaries while remaining engaging and well paced. Despite discussing wordsmiths from over 200 years ago, Anderson delicately balances Franklin and Webster&#x2019;s dreams with grade-level appropriate vocabulary and readability. VERDICT The potentially dry topic of American English etymology is transformed into a delightful, relatable, and eye-catchingly illustrated tale that will have readers rooting for the success of the dictionary. Most collections will want to consider.&#x2013;Emily Beasley, Omaha Public Schools -- School Library Journal, <i>July 2018</i><br><br>Two Founding Fathers team up for their own miniature revolution&#x2014;to simplify and standardize American English. Printer Ben Franklin couldn't stand inconsistent spelling. He wanted to invent some new and remove some old letters to create a phonetic alphabet. Noah Webster also couldn't stand our inconsistent alphabet. He wanted to create a guide to grammar and pronunciation. Both wanted to change the way that Americans used English: "Using twenty-six letters to write forty-four sounds caused nothing but trouble." The two visionaries teamed up to tackle the problem of the "inconvenient alphabet," crafting a new alphabet&#x2014;one in which letters matched sounds and sounds matched letters. When this idea failed to gain widespread support, Webster came up with new plans, this time to revolutionize spelling. His plans for seemingly simpler spellings were also rejected by the populace, leading Webster to create his best-known work: his dictionary. Both Anderson's text and Baddeley's illustrations are energetic and compelling. The latter playfully elucidate examples of the linguistic nuances discussed, showing (for instance) Webster and Franklin manually taking silent letters out of words such as "walk" and "knock." The majority of illustrated figures are white, although a variety of skin tones are presented in each group illustration. Deelytful and iloominaating for noo and seesuned reeders alyk. (author's and illustrator's notes, quotation sources, bibliography) (Informational picture book. 5-8) -- Kirkus, <i>7/15/18</i><br><br>Anyone learning to read and write English, whether as a first or second language, is struck by the inconsistencies involved. Letters make varying sounds. Spellings have rules that must be memorized. What people may not realize, however, is that Benjamin Franklin and Noah Webster teamed up in the early days of the U.S. to try to simplify such matters. Franklin developed a new alphabet with more specific sounds, while Webster advocated eliminating what he considered "unnecessary extras," such as silent letters. The illustrations, rendered using a mix of traditional and digital media as well as partially hand-lettered text, depict Franklin and Webster going about their business with large, three-dimensional alphabet letters bobbing around them like excited pets. Demonstrating perseverance, Franklin and Webster did not succeed completely in convincing others to adopt their point of view, but they did simplify some spellings, and Webster's dictionary was instrumental in making the language more consistent. An extensive bibliography and notes section details the work behind the scenes to make the book factual as well as entertaining. &#x2014; Lucinda Whitehurst -- Booklist, <i>Aug 1, 2018</i><br><br>Ben Franklin&#x2019;s attempt to reimagine the English language with completely phonetic spellings and an altered alphabet was one of his more quixotic inventions. Noah Webster also attempted spelling reform, but despite Franklin&#x2019;s encouragement his efforts were also unsuccessful. This thought-provoking and entertaining exploration of these unsuccessful attempts to change the way we write will raise questions about spelling, American history, and the work of invention. Older students may be inspired to learn more about these colorful historic figures. Amusing illustrations vary from colorful spots to full bleed double page spreads, many of which include speech bubbles. Print-block style letters dance across the pages and interact with a diverse cast of dramatic characters. An extensive author&#x2019;s note reflects on spelling and the evolution of the English language followed by a note about the research that went into the book. An illustrator&#x2019;s note explains some of Baddeley&#x2019;s choices. Bibliography. Source Notes.<br> <br> &nbsp; -- School Library Connection, <i>October 2018</i><br><br>Anderson&#x2019;s debut picture book details the origins of Noah Webster&#x2019;s first American English dictionary and the struggles of Webster and Benjamin Franklin to help unify the new country through language in the 1780s. After laboring alone to streamline American English, the men meet and agree that the dawn of a new nation should also mean the dawn of a new kind of English for its citizens&#x2014;one that would allow them to understand one another. &#x201c;Some spoke like the king of England, others like backwoodsmen, and many barely spoke English at all.&#x201d; The pair join forces over what proves a near-impossible task. Lighthearted illustrations by Baddeley (<i>I Dissent: Ruth Bader Ginsberg Makes Her Mark</i>) feature large, colorful letters that are juggled, balanced, passed around, and left in a crumpled heap as a befuddled citizenry questions and scorns the men&#x2019;s proposals. Other touches, such as the changing expressions of the cameos hanging on Webster&#x2019;s wall, keep the story engaging. With back matter that includes an extensive bibliography, this history succeeds in distilling the sophisticated subject of early American English lexicography into a comprehensible, lively read. -- Publishers Weekly, <i>August 13, 2018</i></p><h2>Nightseer</h2><p>Keleios the Half-Elf was but five years old when she saw her mother murdered by the evil witch Harque.

Believe me, the cross is of deepest importance. This is no mere question of controversy; this is not one of those points on which men may agree to differ and feel that differences will not shut them out of heaven. A man must be right on this subject, or he is lost forever. Heaven or hell, happiness or misery, life or death, blessing or cursing in the last day &#x2013; all hinges on the answer to this question: <b>&#x201c;What do you think about the cross of Christ?&#x201d;</b><br><br>Let me show you:<br><ol><li>What the apostle Paul did not glory in.</li><li>What Paul did glory in.</li><li>Why all Christians should think and feel about the cross like Paul.</li></ol><br><b>About the Author</b><br>John Charles Ryle (1816-1900) graduated from Eton and Oxford and then pursued a career in politics, but due to lack of funds, he entered the clergy of the Church of England. He was a contemporary of Spurgeon, Moody, Mueller, and Taylor and read the great theologians like Wesley, Bunyan, Knox, Calvin, and Luther. These all influenced Ryle&#x2019;s understanding and theology. Ryle began his writing career with a tract following the Great Yarmouth suspension bridge tragedy, where more than a hundred people drowned. He gained a reputation for straightforward preaching and evangelism. He travelled, preached, and wrote more than 300 pamphlets, tracts, and books, including <i>Expository Thoughts on the Gospels, Principles for Churchmen,</i> and <i>Christian Leaders of the Eighteenth Century</i>. Ryle used the royalties from his writing to pay his father&#x2019;s debts, but he also felt indebted to that ruin for changing the direction of his life. He was recommended by Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli to be Bishop of Liverpool where he ended his career in 1900.</p><p></p><h2>Facing Down Fear</h2><p>John Sharp is one of today&#39;s most respected, recognized and larger-than-life professional hunters. The praise garnered for him and his book, FACING DOWN FEAR, is amazing. Robin Hurt: John Sharp is unquestionably one of Zimbabwe&#39;s leading Professional Hunters...(and) As a professional he is in a league of his own. I J Lariviers: FACING DOWN FEAR is much more than a book of hunting stories, it is the incredibly interesting story of someone who has truly lived. Brooke Chilvers-Lubin: No one ever forgets the first time they met Professional Hunter John Sharp. Jim Carmichel: John Sharp joins the list of professional hunters who have great stories to tell and who knows how to tell them. He has earned a reputation for being everything a PH ought to be. Mark Newton (Director Rigby Firearms): If you have the least bit of interest in African hunting and paid the slightest bit of attention to activities involving African hunters over the past four decades, then John Sharp needs no introduction. And finally- Richard Lendrum: If there is one person I would suggest spending a day with in the bush before you or he exits planet earth, it would be John Sharp. But - if you can&#39;t spend a day with John in the bush, then you must spend time with his book FACING DOWN FEAR. Whether hunting lion, leopard, elephant or buffalo John has plenty of stories to tell. One of the most exciting is about when John almost lost his arm due to an encounter with a puff adder. For over 40 years in seven African hunting countries, John has guided a variety of hunting clients, often while facing his own fears, and always giving credit for success to his trackers, staff and client. John is that kind of really good hunter, good guy, and a good writer, too. If you are interested in firearms, then John also has plenty of info to share.

Written during 1942, it uses the birth charts of many world leaders of the time as examples. <br><br> The premise of <strong><em>THE UNIVERSAL MATRIX</em></strong> is significant and intriguing, for in it Rudhyar attributes substantive and causal qualities to the zodiac. In the work, Rudhyar describes the zodiac (the Universal Matrix) as a substantive "electromagnetic field" of "zodiacal influence" which is permanently anchored to the earth, the "emanations" of which "beat constantly upon us." Yet such statements, which might surprise some readers familiar with Rudhyar's astrological work, is actually consistent with his lifelong metaphysics. Indeed, the basic concept of fields enveloping the planet and human beings is of ancient origin, and it is an integral part of Theosophy, from which Rudhyar largely drew his metaphysical underpinnings. <br><br> Here's some sample descriptions: <br><br> <strong>MARS IN LEO</strong><br> "When the Leo-type of energies . . . are activated by the forceful and outgoing planet Mars, fireworks may be expected. This produces a colorful personality, or at least a strong will to dominate . . . There is an intense urge toward dramatic self-expression; and, when concrete materials for self-expression or for personal show are not available, the person is likely to use imaginary materials." <br><br> <strong>MERCURY IN LIBRA</strong><br> "In a negative sense, Mercury in Libra reveals a frivolous, butterfly mentality; and also a social urge which is more a matter of intellectual attitudes than one of deep realizations. Mental pride and sensitiveness to social criticism may be in evidence; or an extreme subservience of the mental life to social or cultural traditions." <br><br> <strong>VENUS IN GEMINI </strong><br> "When Gemini forces are illumined by the presence of Venus, experiences and sensations are valued mostly for the meaning which can be derived from them . . . Thus the person with such a natal configuration may pass from experience to experience, from human contact to more human contacts simply to provide food for the development of her sense of value and her quality of emotional response. . . . They are like the 'kisses' given to the flowers by the bee; all that the bee wants is honey. . . . It is better not to become attached to persons with a natal Venus in Gemini, if one wants lasting happiness; but an intimate (though brief) contact with them should be revealing and stimulating, for they are artists in expression and 'catalytic agents' for growth." <br><br> <strong>MARS IN CANCER</strong><br> "This is a rather unsatisfactory position for Mars, because this planet symbolizes all outgoings and Cancer is a field for the activity of concentrating and indrawing forces. Thus either Mars in Cancer is not allowed to operate with any degree of power by a number of inhibiting influences, or else the energy of Mars is thrust into a work which is not congenial . . . In the former case the person born with Mars in Cancer demonstrates a weak capacity for action and for initiative, great moodiness, irritability or so-called 'artistic' temperament. In the second alternative he tends to act with aggressive selfishness; he makes unreasonable demands upon others . . . loses his sense of proportion and makes a show of himself and his personal problems." <br><br></p><p><strong>DANE RUDHYAR</strong> (1895-1985) was the most important and influential astrologer of the 20th Century, introducing reforms to the ancient practice many practitioners and writers today take for granted. Rudhyar was also probably the most prolific astrological writer, contributing more than 20 books and almost 1,000 articles to modern astrology.</p><h2>The Chocolate Soldier: Heroism: The Lost Chord of Christianity (deeperChristian Classics)</h2><p>Difficulties, dangers, disease, death, or divisions don't deter any but Chocolate Soldiers from executing God's Will. When someone says there is a lion in the way, the real Christian promptly replies, "That's hardly enough inducement for me; I want a bear or two besides to make it worth my while to go." Reading the words of C.T. Studd (1860-1931)&#x2014;Britain&#x2019;s famous cricketer and missionary to China, India, and Africa&#x2014;is no easy endeavor. The words are simple but each phrase is packed with a punch that leaves you reeling, convicted, and yet oddly inspired. If Studd argued that his day was filled with "namby-pamby lukewarm" Chocolate Christians, I fear what he would say about our generation today. And yet his call couldn't be more needed: be a true soldier of Jesus Christ and plunge headlong into the world in the power of His Spirit, to proclaim the Gospel and live out the true, historic, and victorious Christian life. This deeperChristian classic edition includes: � The Chocolate Soldier &#x2014; or also known as: Heroism: The Lost Chord of Christianity � Only One Life, Twill Soon Be Past (a famous poem by Studd) � A collection of poems Studd wrote entitled Quaint Rhymes for the Battlefield � A collection of several of our favorite C.T.

It provides a clear and comprehensive introduction to the New Testament. In a straightforward and understandable style--without distortion or oversimplification--Prof. Metzger closely examines the historical background and content of the New Testament and details the role of scribes and translators in handing the Scriptures down through the centuries. Utilizing the finest modern scholarship, Dr. Metzger looks at the people, societies, and events that produced the New Testament. Palestinian Judaism, Greco-Roman paganism, sources of our knowledge of Jesus Christ, essential aspects of Christ&#39;s teaching, sources and chronology of the apostolic age, the work of Paul, the general letters, and the Book of Revelation are all clearly illuminated. The Second edition of this book added an appendix on the formation of the canon of the New Testament and the work of scribes. The third edition will represent a substantial update of the 1965 text based on the New Revised Standard Version. In addition to stylistic changes, the author updates the text regarding research on the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi tractates.

Secondarily this volume initiates the reader to the wonders and workings of language and points out how language is often misused, especially in regard to the Bible. This volume, however, in no way anticipates all the ways of mishandling language. Silva's emphasis is on "global" rather than detailed concerns (though selected specific examples are used) of how language is misused. The book includes an account of the birth and growth of modern linguistics, an appreciation of its interdisciplinary character, particularly its ties with literary criticism, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and science. It surveys all levels of language description, but emphasizes the semantic and stylistic aspects of grammar and syntax, vocabulary, and discourse. In addition, it considers the transmission of the Bible (textual criticism and translation) as a mode of linguistic communication and interpretive process.</p></p><p>Mois�s Silva taught biblical studies at Westmont College, Westminster Theological Seminary, and Gordon-Conwell Seminary.

The Priestess, who is from the royal House of Avalon, that mysterious island shrouded in mists and magic, marries Flavius Valerius Constantius, who becomes a Roman Emperor, and she becomes the mother of Constantine. As we learn about Roman history, we also see Christianity grasp and then hold sway in the world. Bradley and Paxson add flavor and beauty to this chaotic time in the Roman Empire. Davina Porter tells this first-person tale in voices that alternate between soft and imperial, with slight variations for the men. She brings the magic and mystery to the surface with gentle intonation and fluid narration. As Roman history and Christianity make their marks on the world, Avalon seeks to keep its mists and with them the strength of alternate beliefs about the nature of the world.

In 1945 she illustrated <i>The Little Fisherman</i>, her first children's book, a classic Golden Book written by noted children's author Margaret Wise Brown. Ipcar went on to write and illustrate thirty children's books of her own. She also wrote four fantasy novels for a slightly older audience, as well as a volume of short stories for adults. Her art is significant in the social realism movement. In 1972 Dahlov and her husband together received the Maine Governor's Award for "significant contributions to Maine in the broad field of the arts and humanities." She also received three honorary degrees from The University of Maine, Colby, and Bates colleges. In 1998 The University of Minnesota honored Dahlov with The Kerlan Award for Children's literature. In 2012 the Farnsworth Museum gave Dahlov the Maine In America Award, an honor given to an individual or group who has made an outstanding contribution to Maine and its role in American Art.

How it is that Western antipathy, once thought due to anti-Communism, could be so easily revived over a crisis in distant Ukraine, against a Russia no longer communist? Why does the West accuse Russia of empire-building, when 15 states once part of the defunct Warsaw Pact are now part of NATO, and NATO troops now flank the Russian border? These are only some of the questions Creating Russophobia iinvestigates. Mettan begins by showing the strength of the prejudice against Russia through the Western response to a series of events: the Uberlingen mid-air collision, the Beslan hostage- taking, the Ossetia War, the Sochi Olympics and the crisis in Ukraine. He then delves into the historical, religious, ideological and geopolitical roots of the detestation of Russia in various European nations over thirteen centuries since Charlemagne competed with Byzantium for the title of heir to the Roman Empire. Mettan examines the geopolitical machinations expressed in those times through the medium of religion, leading to the great Christian schism between Germanic Rome and Byzantium and the European Crusades against Russian Orthodoxy. This history of taboos, prejudices and propaganda directed against the Orthodox Church provides the mythic foundations that shaped Western disdain for contemporary Russia. From the religious and imperial rivalry created by Charlemagne and the papacy to the genesis of French, English, German and then American Russophobia, the West has been engaged in more or less violent hostilities against Russia for a thousand years. Contemporary Russophobia is manufactured through the construction of an anti-Russian discourse in the media and the diplomatic world, and the fabrication and demonization of The Bad Guy, now personified by Vladimir Putin. Both feature in the meta-narrative, the mythical framework of the ferocious Russian bear ruled with a rod of iron by a vicious president. A synthetic reading of all these elements is presented in the light of recent events and in particular of the Ukrainian crisis and the recent American elections, showing how all the resources of the West&#x2019;s soft power have been mobilized to impose the tale of bad Russia dreaming of global conquest. &#x201c;By hating Russia, one hurts oneself. Swiss journalist Guy Mettan pieces together the reasons of detestation of the Kremlin and of a rhetoric that goes back to Napoleonic times despite the long list of aggressions perpetrated in the meantime by the West. And he explains why pushing Moscow toward Asia is a very serious error.&#x201d; &#x2014;Panorama, Italy &#x201c;Like Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s mythical weapons of massive destruction in 2003, Peter the Great&#x2019;s fake will has been used to justify the aggressions and invasions that the Europeans, and now the Americans, still carry out against Russia.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lib�ration, France</p><p>GUY METTAN is a journalist and Swiss politician. Former director and editor-in-chief of the main Geneva newspaper Tribune de Gen�ve, he is presently the executive director of the Geneva Press Club and columnist for various Swiss newspapers. Member the Geneva Parliament since 2001, he was the speaker of the Parliament in 2010. Author of several books on Switzerland and international Geneva, he wrote a successful book on western russophobia published by Editions des Syrtes in 2015. There are now French, Italian, Russian, Serbian and Swedish editions of this title, in addition to this one in English.from the Foreword:<br><br>From the very first weeks of my journalistic internship at Journal de Gen�ve, a once prestigious but now defunct liberal newspaper, I learnt the meaning of the double standards western media and western statesmen apply when they pass judgment on countries or political regimes they do not like. I had hardly settled down at my desk when a meeting of the World Anticommunist League was held in Geneva sometime during the spring of 1980. Balmy weather was forecast that weekend and none of the resident pen pushers were eager to go and cover the meeting. So I was sent. Gathered together there was the darnedest posse of dictators and butchers of the planet: Augusto Pinochet emissaries, Argentinian generals, and Korean, Taiwanese, and other representatives of then proliferating Asian dictatorships. The brows of these dignitaries, ill at ease in their civilian garb, eyes hidden behind dark glasses as in B movies, seemed to me to be still bearing the imprints of their just discarded kepis. I went back to the paper, faithfully summed up what I had seen and what had been said, without any supervision, of course, as it was Sunday.<br><br>What a commotion on Monday morning! I was summoned to the office of the editor in chief to face anofficial warning. I had made the mistake of not knowing that one of the newspaper's main shareholders was the Swiss representative of the League and that discrimination was of the essence. Not all dictatorships were alike. Some were good, those of pro-western generals, and some bad, those in Russia and Eastern Europe. You did not say "these are dictators who imprison their opponents and torture their political prisoners" but "these are defenders of the Free World which they protect against the communist infection." Lesson number one, which I was never to forget.<br><br>A few years later, on November 19, 1985, the first Reagan-Gorbachev summit took place in Geneva. It was the first time since the Vietnam War, the intrusion of the Red Army into Afghanistan, the Euro missile crisis, and the launch of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative in March 1983, that the leaders of East and West were meeting. It was also the first time the Kremlin came up with a youngish leader flanked by an attractive spouse who rapidly made the covers of the tabloids and quickly fell for that illusory glory. It was on my 29th birthday and I still remember vividly the huge hope but also the feeling of inconsistency that meeting had fostered in me...</p><h2>King of the Comics: One Hundred Years of King Features Syndicate</h2><p><b>King Features has had a more illustrious and long-lasting history than any newspaper syndicate, even as it leads the way into the digital age and beyond.</b><br><br>Krazy Kat!

It opens with the horrifying moment in July 1942 when the author&#x2019;s father, the rabbi of a small synagogue, was dragged by police from the family home on Rue Ordener in Paris, then transported to Auschwitz&#x2014;&#x201c;the place,&#x201d; writes Kofman, &#x201c;where no eternal rest would or could ever be granted.&#x201d; It ends in the mid-1950s, when Kofman enrolled at the Sorbonne.The book is as eloquent as it is forthright. Kofman recalls her father and family in the years before the war, then turns to the terrors and confusions of her own childhood in Paris during the German occupation. Not long after her father&#x2019;s disappearance, Kofman and her mother took refuge in the apartment of a Christian woman on Rue Labat, where they remained until the Liberation. This bold woman, whom Kofman called M�m�, undoubtedly saved the young girl and her mother from the death camps. But Kofman&#x2019;s close attachment to M�m� also resulted in a rupture between mother and child that was never to be fully healed.This slender volume is distinguished by the author&#x2019;s clear prose, the carefully recounted horrors of her childhood, and the uncommon poise that came to her only with the passage of many years.</p><p><i>Rue Ordener,</i> <i>Rue Labat </i>was first published in France in 1994.

Hey, you never know!</p><p>An ALA Notable Book A Horn Book Fanfare Selection A School Library Journal Best Book of the Year A Teachers' Choices Selection</p></p><p>Author David M. Schwartz and illustrator Steven Kellogg, who teamed up for the jubilant <i>How Much Is a Million</i>, have returned to the subject of money in <i>If You Made a Million</i>. Marvelosissimo the Mathematical Magician and his team of cheerful kids (and their multitude of animal friends) wield dusters, brooms, plungers, shovels, and cement as they take on feeding fish, dusting ducks, painting pots, transplanting trees, building bridges, and babysitting ogres. For each job, they'll be paid an appropriate amount of money. But soon the questions arise--what does that much money look like, and how can it be spent, saved, or used to pay off a loan?<p> "One dollar is worth as much as FOUR QUARTERS or TEN DIMES or TWENTY NICKELS or ONE HUNDRED PENNIES," Marvelosissimo explains, and we witness all the coins, crowding the page. How many and how high a stack is $100 in pennies? Ten thousand of them, in a stack 50-feet high, teeter precariously near a phenomenal airport where the gates are reached via tightrope. Next, Marvelosissimo takes readers to the Bank--a huge edifice complete with red carpets, carved slogans ("Save" and "Be Wise"), and frog attendants--where he explains the concepts of interest and bank loans. Grown-up text brings up the rear of the book, providing additional information on banks, interest and compound interest, checking accounts, loans, and income tax. Throughout, Kellogg's illustrations--highly detailed with silly objects, people, and animals--will keep kids' attention, but the pictures never detract from Schwartz's message that "enjoying your work is more important than money," and "making money means making choices."

First-wave feminists in the US and in Britain used needlework in their demonstrations and public protest lectures during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Needlework and other handcrafts, however, declined throughout the twentieth century. But in the 21st century, there has been a steep resurgence and many are turning to crafting, especially needlework, as an activist strategy. In <i>Knitting for Good</i>, feminist Betsy Greer makes this point strongly when she proclaims, &#x201c;I think every act of making is an act of revolution.&#x201d;</p><p>Featuring more than 40 truly original cross stitch designs, the book also contains instructions on techniques for new stitchers. The projects include: <br>- I am very upset<br>- Brace yourself--women are coming<br>- Too many issues to fit in one place<br>- Nobody likes you<br>- No you can't take my rights, I'm still using them<br>- Just Urgh<br>- I can't believe I still have to protest this shit<br>- Girls just wanna have FUNdamental rights<br>- Damn right we're snowflakes; winter is coming!<br>- Gram 'em by the patriarchy<br>- I will not go quietly back to the 1950s<br>- Same shit, different century<br>- I'm so angry I made this<br>- We're not just nasty women, we're REVOLTING<br>- My body, my insatiable thirst for revenge<br>- Down with this sort of thing<br>-Nevertheless she persisted<br>- We are sisters</p></p><p>Rayna Fahey is a radical crafter, organiser, mother, activist, gardener, writer and lover ... and that is just the start. Rayna is a do-er with heart. She mixes making with politics and friends. She gained infamy through her street art adventures in cross stitching fences. She gained further notoriety as a feature maker in the film &#x201c;Making it Handmade&#x201d;. Rayna came to craft from the determination to make the world a better place and this book is her love letter to those taking the struggle to the streets.</p><h2>Living Prayer</h2><p><b>Living Prayer</b> is the story of Robert Benson's quest across ecumenical and denominational lines in search of windows into the mystery of prayer. Weaving a narrative about his experiences while seeking a prayerful life, he demonstrates how prayer can enter the fabric of one's existence so that life itself becomes prayer. In the manner of Madeleine L'Engle and Kathleen Norris, <b>Benson</b> makes the ordinary events of life seem mystical and the mystical seem ordinary. He illustrates the full power of prayer, illuminates the reasons we are drawn to pray, and bears witness to the grace of leading a life attuned to the voice of God.</p><p><b>Robert Benson</b> is the author of <b>Living Prayer, Venite</b>, and <b>Between the Dreaming and the Coming True</b>. He lives in Nashville.Benson (Between the Dreaming and the Coming True) narrates the story of his quest across ecumenical and denominational lines in search of windows into the mystery of prayer. He illustrates the full power of prayer, illuminates the reasons we are drawn to pray and bears witness to the grace of leading a life attuned to the voice of God. Throughout his story, Benson describes the life of prayer as a dance. He urges us to discover the rhythms of life that can be found in the Ancient Dance of the Ancient Days: the liturgy; the Eucharist; the calendar and the mass; the prayers of confession, intercession, recollection and contemplation; the habits of reading and retreat and working with our hands; the practices of hospitality and forgiveness and being with the poor. Benson also contends that place is one of the steps in the Ancient Dance. Prayer has been most meaningful to him in places that have been set aside for God to inhabit, places that have been marked for worship and prayer and places to which those who are seeking God have been called forth to hope and rest and listen. Benson discovers a way of prayer that is both old and new, and he shows that living prayer is the beginning of a journey that starts with learning to listen. Benson's beautifully measured prose lures readers into the prayer as a dynamic dance of life. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Help My Unbelief, 20th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><p>Sermons of hope and faith for those who have lost both.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us struggle with doubt, uncertainty, and disbelief.

But too often, astrology devolves into meaningless clich&#39;s or impersonal newspaper horoscopes. In the early part of this century Marc Edmund Jones and Dane Rudhyar liberated astrology from the fatalistic approach of the medieval world. They took power from the high-and-mighty archaic planet gods, and offered it back to human beings. Here, at the end of the century, Inside Planets goes further, invoking each planet as a mighty full-bodied organism with a character and a soul of its own, a living breathing force with passion and humor and purpose that changes as it moves through the houses and signs. Each planet grabs you by the imagination and drags you to the campfire of The Greatest Story Even Told. Far more than an astrology guide, this book resuscitates from the ancient mystery temples of Atlantis an elegant and inspiring pantheon of wonder, terror, and creative solution to the problems that plague the soul.</p><p>Ellias Lonsdale is the author of <i>Star Rhythms</i>, <i>The Book of Theanna</i>, and <i>Inside Degrees</i>.

Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) during the final three years of its four-year lifespan, from 1995 to 1998, and is the first U.S. government official involved with the medical evidence to allege a coverup in President Kennedy&#39;s autopsy, and in the creation of the autopsy photographs and x-rays. This book, the product of over 13 years of writing and research, provides the best explanation yet offered of the true nature of the medical coverup in the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and does so in meticulous detail, with scrupulous use of primary source material. It incorporates the latest information---much of it new evidence not revealed elsewhere---gleaned from the ARRB&#39;s depositions and interviews of medical witnesses, conducted from 1996 to 1998. With precise accuracy, and with a relentless focus on the massive fraud uncovered in the official records of the 35th President&#39;s assassination, Horne presents a persuasive case that the assassination of JFK was an &#34;inside job,&#34; a true coup d&#39;etat in America, that was ruthlessly and brazenly covered up by those who &#39;broke the back of the American century&#39; in Dallas on November 22, 1963. IN VOLUME TWO, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES HIS EXHAUSTIVE STUDY OF THE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTION IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES, AND PRESENTS THE READER WITH AN EQUALLY THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE AUTOPSY X-RAYS, PROVING THAT THE THREE JFK SKULL X-RAYS IN THE OFFICIAL RECORD ARE FORGED, COMPOSITE COPY-FILMS (FORGERIES) CREATED FROM THE AUTHENTIC X-RAYS OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY&#39;S SKULL TAKEN AT THE AUTOPSY. HE ALSO RELATES THE RESULTS OF THE ARRB&#39;S CRUCIAL INTERVIEWS WITH THE MORTICIANS WHO PREPARED THE PRESIDENT FOR BURIAL, AND WITH PARKLAND HOSPITAL WITNESSES WHO HAD NEVER BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE GOVERNMENT PREVIOUSLY.

Often my seat neighbors will ask me what I do. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a corporate trainer,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I help organizations trying to change. Because no matter what their business, how well they manage change will determine their success. They need to be ready.&#x201d;<br><br> Change in the same sentence as success often gets their attention, and then they ask, &#x201c;How do you train a company to change?&#x201d;<br><br> My answer is always the same: &#x201c;Well, once I teach a company&#x2019;s people the stages of change and how to navigate them, workplace changes are much easier to take.&#x201d;<br><br> Marketplace shifts, new industry standards, a current event with company impact&#x2014;businesses are hit with myriad changes. I make the point that when speaking of change, the emphasis must go to the company&#x2019;s people. Change only becomes a reality within a business or organization when its individual members commit and carry out the new initiative, accommodate the new structure, follow the new system, or turn out the new product.<br><br> This sometimes causes a moment of skepticism in my seatmates. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; they say, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s all we ever hear&#x2014; change this, change that.&#x201d; They comment on how fast change happens, how it happens all the time&#x2014;how 2important change is&#x2014;but no one ever seems to know how to do it well, whether personally or professionally.<br><br> At this point in my airplane conversation, I usually admit that despite fifteen years as a &#x201c;change agent,&#x201d; I, too, struggle with life&#x2019;s changes at times&#x2014;at home and at work. Some changes are great&#x2014;a new love, a promotion, a financial bonus&#x2014;but many changes in life (maybe most) are simply hard, really hard: a company layoff, a divorce, the death of a loved one, a business failure. They hurt. They make us feel out of control.<br><br> Knowing that even a change professional can have trouble coping with change seems to somehow comfort my seatmates. The next question they typically ask is, &#x201c;Can you help regular people deal with change?&#x201d; By this time I know a conversation about some difficulty of theirs is coming. So I make it easy for them by explaining that managing change is more about understanding and accepting a set of common human reactions than it is about some kind of &#x201c;attitude adjustment.&#x201d;<br><br> Change is life, life is change. It just happens, like the weather. Changes result from chance, choice, or crisis, and are generally unpredictable. But the process of &#x201c;how&#x201d; we move through life&#x2019;s changes is predictable, I explain. This usually brings a measure of both curiosity and relief.<br><br> In my work I have seen many employees struggling to adjust and regain their productivity following some new initiative or shift in leadership and direction. Both professionally and in my personal life, I have seen people grasping at straws trying to make sense of circumstances that leave them at a loss as to what to think or do next.<br><br> 3<br> I&#x2019;ve seen people in &#x201c;change pain&#x201d;&#x2014;sad, mad, angry, blaming, afraid&#x2014;their sense of loss and confusion often driving their lives into uncharted emotional waters. These are places they wouldn&#x2019;t have to go (or at least enter so deeply) if they understood more about the universal process of change: what to do, and what not to do, as they progress through the regular and sequential pattern of experiences that is The Change Cycle.<br><br> By this point in the conversation I&#x2019;m drawing on a napkin, explaining how we as humans are wired to react and respond to change in six stages, how these stages are defined by characteristic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how (best yet) they occur in an order that can be anticipated, so much of the mystery of What&#x2019;s happening? or What will happen next? is eased.<br><br> Then I ask my seat neighbor if there is a change in their life that is causing some angst. Sensing I won&#x2019;t judge them and seeming appreciative to have a chance to talk, they tell me things like, &#x201c;My husband just got laid off,&#x201d; or, &#x201c;My mother recently passed away.&#x201d; &#x201c;My oldest just dropped out of college,&#x201d; they might say, or, &#x201c;My best friend has breast cancer.&#x201d; Sometimes it&#x2019;s just, &#x201c;I have a new boss.&#x201d; I listen as they tell their stories. The way they talk&#x2014;the words they choose, the thoughts and emotions they describe&#x2014;are clues I need to determine which stage they are in now. I show them where they are, explain what it means, and suggest what they might consider or explore or do next. Sooner or later, I assure them, they&#x2019;ll feel back in control, though they may not ever actually like or appreciate the change.<br><br> 4<br> I love this moment. It&#x2019;s the one when they get it&#x2014;&#x201d;it&#x201d; being the reminder that whatever they are going through, it&#x2019;s only temporary. After all, I tell them, just because you have a flat tire doesn&#x2019;t mean you have forgotten how to drive.<br><br> And then we share a laugh.<br><br> Knowing what&#x2019;s likely to happen next is the part that gives people the most comfort. Yes, when brought to their attention, they see the pattern&#x2014;the natural sequence of change, just like there is a cycle of the seasons or phases of the moon.<br><br> Through the years, I&#x2019;ve heard hundreds of change stories. At 37,000 feet I have listened to tales of life&#x2019;s battles lost, and life&#x2019;s wars won, of changes that brought some people to their knees and propelled others to new emotional heights. For all the good and bad that can be said about life, the fact is we will all face challenging transitions&#x2014;personally and professionally&#x2014;that will continue at varying intensities throughout our lives.<br><br> Learning to manage change is a skill we all need to acquire, improve, and master&#x2014;in all aspects of our lives. I hope this book will assist you in improving your change resiliency and help you find your footing during times when the going gets tough.<br> The Focus of Our Book Change@Work<br><br> When we speak of work or professional changes, we mean both the &#x201c;big ones&#x201d; and the mundane ones, the ones that took weeks or even months to complete and the ones that kicked in overnight, the ones that seemed ridiculous but<br><br> 5<br> turned out pretty good, and the ones that appeared to be no-brainers but crashed and burned. This book provides a framework to assist you in gaining perspective on the change and its impact, insight that will guide you through the transition.<br><br> Our central goal is to help you take responsibility for how you react and respond to a changing work environment by giving you tools of self-awareness and assessment&#x2014;instruments to light the curves and bumps on your change road. It&#x2019;s all about getting through the change emotion and commotion with minimal damage to your blood pressure, career, relationships, productivity, and confidence&#x2014;whatever your role in the company or organization.<br><br> It is our belief that there is no magic way to achieve a pain-free experience of a significant work change&#x2014;or a significant life change, for that matter. But understanding the regular, cyclical nature of the process helps you navigate the change in a conscious, anticipatory way, minimizing the fear, loss, resentment, and anxiety which to one degree or another accompany so many changes in work and life.<br><br> For all we know about the science and predictability of change, there is still the mystery of intensity when it comes to individual reactions. A change that might rock one person&#x2019;s world can be a speed bump to another. Each of us experiences change with our own scoreboard correlating to where we are on our path through life. And this variability extends to companies&#x2014;collections of individuals&#x2014; as well. It is amazing to be in one workplace where productivity might decline simply due to the distraction of a new food-service vendor, while at another company such<br><br> 6<br> a decline would only result from layoffs or similar major change.<br><br> In the pages ahead, you will encounter many different examples of workplace change. Some we might call &#x201c;change bombs&#x201d;&#x2014;devastating losses to companies and individuals: a plant closing, a product recall, workplace violence, executive corruption. Other changes might seem trivial in comparison, but as we suggest above, almost any company change can have real impact, and depending on certain factors (management style, workplace culture, change track-record), it can seriously affect morale&#x2014;to the point where what would appear to be a &#x201c;small&#x201d; change can give rise to employee anger, blame, resistance, and lethargy.<br><br> In a way, organizational change brings a set of dynamics akin to family or relationship dynamics: little things can become big things over time; employees have &#x201c;long memories.&#x201d; If management is cavalier in making changes that impact employee convenience (parking, food, dress code), when it comes time for a company to initiate a major change, reaction will be partly predicated on employees&#x2019; prickly memories of what has come before. The bottom line? The price of frequent, chaotic, or mismanaged change can be high. Change management requires care; no change is too small for skilled handling.<br><br> We wrote this book for anyone charged with communicating, carrying out, integrating, or simply dealing with a challenging work transition. We focus on the human perspective. We take as seriously as we can everything that comes into play during a change at work, not only company rollout strategies and management-employee 7relations but also the effects on people&#x2019;s work performance, schedules, interactions with colleagues, energy levels, morale, and life at home.<br><br> A change at work is like throwing a rock into a lake&#x2014; there will be ripples, and often they extend into your non-work life too. We try to never lose sight of the fact that the separation between work and home can be narrow, often very narrow. Happily, in helping you better deal with workplace change, these pages teach lessons that carry over into your nonwork life&#x2014;a positive not only for you and those close to you, but also for your company or organization. Fewer ripples at home mean fewer at work&#x2014;and of course the reverse is also true.<br> The Challenge of Change<br><br> Why is organizational change so difficult?<br><br> Because teams, departments, sites, mom-and-pop entrepreneurial businesses, companies small and large, school systems, governments, and global organizations cannot effectively transform unless their workers and members are committed to the change. This holds true whatever the impetus, crisis, challenge, or well-constructed strategic plan, whatever the rewards of success or consequences of failure. People must buy in.<br><br> No matter the value or process employed to make the change, there will be unforeseen implementation issues and underlying dynamics created by the workplace environment and the organization&#x2019;s communication style. If change is initiated in a decree from the top brass and the news then makes its way down through the ranks, 8what we call the &#x201c;they factor&#x201d;&#x2014;How did they decide?, &#x201c;How do they know?, They have no idea&#x2014;can arise among employees and lodge a stick in the spokes of the transition.<br><br> Another challenge stems from the gap in change-assimilating between those company leaders who conceived of the change and those who one day learn about it. Execs and upper management can be significantly further along in The Change Cycle than those at the employee and lower-management levels who are suddenly mandated with &#x201c;making it happen.&#x201d;<br><br> When change is initiated within the workforce itself, it has a different set of implementation issues. By and large, these issues work themselves out more quickly, and the change impacts service and product quality standards for the good. Communication is more relevant and timely. There&#x2019;s more ownership of the need to change, which leads to superior identifying of problems and solution-creating, a circumstance less prone to the-old-way versus the-new-way struggle some top-down decisions create.<br><br> Supervisors and managers are the most important link to the potential success of any change, because it is up to them to carry the ball for the ongoing communication after the initial announcement. Successful strategic initiatives and organizational change require above-average attention and commitment to communication, above-average leadership and management skills. Executives, managers, and supervisors must be willing to go beyond job and industry know-how to valuing learning and excelling at people skills&#x2014;aka communication skills&#x2014;in order to successfully facilitate and manage the ongoing 9changes at all levels within any organization. This includes being willing and able to look forward with fervor to what might be.<br><br> The first and most significant issue is this: managers and leaders must be willing and able to manage themselves. Individually, they must take responsibility for how they tend to react in changing environments. In dealing with change, managers and leaders must address their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors before they can address anyone else&#x2019;s.<br><br> Often workplace higher-ups say things like, &#x201c;We have to beat this thing.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Change or die.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;We gotta swim with the sharks.&#x201d; These types of comments are indicative of the survival mentality common in the early stages of change. &#x201c;Can you swim with the sharks?&#x201d; should not be the focus or concern. &#x201c;Can you swim at all?&#x201d; is the issue. If yes, teach others. If no, grab your floatie and jump into the water&#x2014;we can change that.<br> The Pull of the Past<br><br> One of the reasons people find change so hard is they have never been taught to understand the emotional and cognitive challenges that change creates. The latest brain science and cognitive psychology studies continue to point to memory as a key indicator of how we will react during an unfolding change situation. Whether you are reading this book as a worker, manager, or leader, you probably don&#x2019;t need research to persuade you that unresolved thoughts and feelings about &#x201c;how some things were handled&#x201d; in previous company changes are a significant reason employees can<br><br> 10<br> have a hard time believing or trusting their employer when a new change is introduced. Our recollections of unfortunate or difficult past changes can insinuate themselves into our general outlook and cause skepticism, cynicism, bitterness, and other states not conducive to workplace concentration and performance.<br><br> Memories have a dramatic impact on how we interpret what is or might be happening to us and why. And even if the memories aren&#x2019;t actually resourceful&#x2014;meaning there is no close connection between the past change and the one you are experiencing now&#x2014;the brain has a way of editing, reshaping, and generalizing the &#x201c;historical&#x201d; information, calling it useful and sending it to you anyway. You then try to superimpose it on the current situation as if this could be the key to solving your issues or problems. The good news is, it could be valid and helpful information that gives you direction. The bad news is, it could turn out to be a distortion or generalization that takes you down the wrong dark alley.<br> The Role of &#x201c;Schema&#x201d;<br><br> Human beings have always had a complicated relationship with change. Is it good? Is it bad? The combination of our memories and the power of our personalities (whether we motivate ourselves with new challenges or a need for security) is what pushes or pulls the change to the good or bad side of the line. Just why is our memory so powerful a driver of our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors? Because as humans, we first view change&#x2014; whether we categorize it as good or bad&#x2014;as something<br><br> 11<br> that can cause loss of control. This provokes primal fears, even turning it into a survival issue: fight or flight. And if that sounds a little dramatic for everyday workplace change, it remains true that the brain runs all new experiences through its self-protection cir...</p><h2>The Tortoise or the Hare</h2><p>Nobel Prize recipient Toni Morrison and Slade Morrison breathe new life into a classic Aesop&#x2019;s fable.<br><br>In the well-known tale of &#x201c;The Tortoise and the Hare,&#x201d; everyone remembers that &#x201c;slow and steady wins the race&#x201d;&#x2014;or does it?

When Jimi and Jamey sign up for a race, one practices while the other plans. The tortoise is told that reversals, such as the winner who loses, make the most satisfying newspaper story.

In the process, Richard delivers great speeches and engages in formidable confrontations with a large cast of characters, almost all of them caught up in the terrible struggle for power that dominates the play. It is a tribute to Shakespeare's dramatic genius and knowledge of human psychology that by the end of the drama the detestable Richard begins to elicit some sympathy for the awful plight in which he finds himself. Explanatory footnotes and an introductory note are included.</p><p>King Richard III is one of Shakespeare&#39;s most popular and frequently-performed plays. Janis Lull&#39;s introduction to this new edition, which is based on the First Folio, emphasises the play&#39;s tragic themes--individual identity, determinism and choice--and stresses the importance of women&#39;s roles. A thorough performance history of stage and film versions shows how the text has been cut, rewritten and re-shaped by directors and actors to enhance the role of Richard at the expense of other parts, especially those of the women.An exciting new edition of the complete works of Shakespeare with these features: Illustrated with photographs from New York Shakespeare Festival productions, vivid readable readable introductions for each play by noted scholar David Bevington, a lively personal foreword by Joseph Papp, an insightful essay on the play in performance, modern spelling and pronunciation, up-to-date annotated bibliographies, and convenient listing of key passages.</p><h2>Traditional Costumes of Saudi Arabia: The Mansoojat Foundation Collection</h2><p><ul><li>A resplendent selection of garments from the many tribes who call Saudi Arabia home</li><li>Developed in partnership with the Mansoojat Foundation: a charity dedicated to preserving ethnic textiles and designs</li><li>An informative, accessible and beautiful celebration of culture</li></ul>Born out of fourteen years of collaboration with the Mansoojat Foundation, this book pays homage to Saudi Arabia's rich textile heritage. From the Labah Sadr of the Bal Harith tribe (a silver necklace decorated with colored glass beads, often recycled from old car lights) to the resplendent jasmine headdresses worn by the Jazan, Traditional Costumes of Saudi Arabia captures the stunning scope of traditional accessories and garb. <br><br>Bright colors, bold patterns, intricate detail and eye-catching designs - the beauty of Arabian textiles is undeniable. Yet many in the western world do not appreciate the extent to which costume and culture are intertwined. Each headdress, thobe and necklace is an expression of identity, incorporating Islamic, Indian, Indonesian, Malay and Chinese influences that date back to the days of the Silk Road. Preserving costumes that are no longer worn and celebrating those which remain at the heart of communities, this book provides valuable insight into the history of Saudi Arabia through the voices of its oldest inhabitants.</p><p>Soraya Altorki is Professor of Anthropology in the Department of Sociology, Egyptology and Anthropology at The American University in Cairo.

The collapse of France in 1870 had an overwhelming impact - on Paris, on France and on the rest of the world. People everywhere saw Paris as the centre of Europe and the hub of culture, fashion and invention. But suddenly France, not least to the disbelief of her own citizens, was gripped in the vice of the Prussian armies and forced to surrender on humiliating terms. Almost immediately Paris was convulsed by the savage self-destruction of the newly formed Socialist government, the Commune. In this brilliant study of the Siege of Paris and its aftermath, Alistair Horne researches first-hand accounts left by official observers, private diarists and letter-writers to evoke the high drama of those ten tumultuous months and the spiritual and physical agony that Paris and the Parisians suffered as they lost the Franco-Prussian war.

Under the ideal of Shinto, a divinely descended emperor governs through rituals offered to deities called Kami. These rituals are practiced in innumerable shrines across the realm, so that local rites mirror the monarch's ceremonies. Through this theatre of state, it is thought, the human, natural, and supernatural worlds will align in harmony and prosper. <br><br>Often called "the indigenous religion of Japan," Shinto's institutions, rituals, and symbols are omnipresent throughout the island nation. But, perhaps surprisingly, both its religiosity and its Japanese origins have been questioned. Hardacre investigates the claims about Shinto as the embodiment of indigenous tradition, and about its rightful place in the public realm. Shinto has often been represented in the West as the engine that drove Japanese military aggression. To this day, it is considered provocative for members of the government to visit the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which honors the Japanese war dead, and this features as a source of strain in Japan's relations with China and Korea. The Yasukuni Shrine is a debated issue in Japanese national politics and foreign relations and reliably attracts intensive media coverage. Hardacre contends, controversially, that it was the Allied Occupation that created this stereotype of Shinto as the religion of war, when in fact virtually all branches of Japanese religions were cheerleaders for the war and imperialism.<br><br>The history and nature of Shinto are subjects of vital importance for understanding contemporary Japan, its politics, its international relations, and its society. Hardacre's magisterial work will stand as the definitive reference for years to come.<br></p><p><br><strong>Helen Hardacre</strong> is Reischauer Institute Professor of Japanese Religions and Society at Harvard University. Concentrating on Japanese religious history of the modern period, she has done extended field study of contemporary Shinto and Buddhist religious organizations, the religious life of Japan's Korean minority, and contemporary ritualization of abortion. She has also researched State Shinto and directs a research project on constitutional revision in Japan.<br><br>"<em>Shinto: A History</em> is a well written and interesting book, worth the time of readers with an interest in Shinto or Japanese history in general." -- Kenneth J. Valencich, <em>Reading Religion</em><p></p><br>"This brilliant study... is a welcome addition... a source of valuable teaching material, and more in general a must-read" -- Ugo Dessi, <em>Religious Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"Her portrayal of the history of Shinto is based on decades of her own research, and undoubtedly this work will occupy the rank of a standard work for a long time, both for students and specialists in the field. Shinto research will benefit greatly as a whole. After the turning point marked by the revolutionary approach of Kuroda Toshio, international research on Shinto has since then led to a sometimes ideological dogmatization of what might be said and not. Helen Hardacre's book gives a fresh breath to the debate, which can only deepen our further understanding of the still-puzzling topic of Shinto." --Klaus Antoni, <em>Journal of Religion</em><p></p><br>"Hardacre's achievement in this work will be hard to supersede. This book could be used in all kind of courses, from introductory or advanced undergraduate to graduate seminars, not only on Japanese religions but Japanese culture in general and even on comparative subjects. Students will benefit from the comprehensive and in-depth narration, while the book provides ample clues and opportunities for additional research and revisions. <em>Shinto: A History,</em> which in its comprehensive and encyclopedia nature does not even have a counterpart in Japanese, is a scholarly milestone that will orient for years the study of Shinto and Japanese religions as a whole."--Fabio Rambelli, <em>Journal of Religion in Japan</em><p></p><br>"At nearly seven hundred pages, it is difficult to think of any adjective other than 'magisterial' to describe Hardacre's new survey on Shinto As the single most comprehensive book on Shinto, Hardacre's book is a must-read her focus on the problems of indigeneity and the public/private distinction moves the field forward considerably."--Jolyon B. Thomas, <em>H-Net Reviews</em><p></p><br>"This work has been long anticipated. The culmination of a lifetime's dedication to the study of Japanese religions by a major scholar in the field, <em>Shinto: A History</em> is both authoritative and comprehensive. Professor Hardacre manages to lead us carefully and judiciously on a long journey through what can often be recalcitrant, complex material. The notoriously difficult question 'What is Shinto?' has finally been answered." --Richard Bowring, Professor Emeritus, Japanese Studies, University of Cambridge <br><p></p><br>"<em>Shinto: A History</em> is a milestone work for the study of Shinto. Hardacre provides a comprehensive vision to integrate the usually unrelated research on Shinto in the West and in Japan. Calling into question our conventional wisdom about Shinto, the author masterfully demonstrates that Shinto is a heterogeneous tradition that changed with time, and it encompasses not only shrine Shinto and state Shinto but also popular cultural practices including public festivals seemingly unconstrained by the Japanese emperor system." --Jun'ichi Isomae, Study of Religions, Research Department, International Research Center for Japanese Studies <br><p></p><br>"Hardacre's study is particularly useful for understanding the religious resources that the Japanese people drew on to build and maintain their local communities. Her subject is their worship of spirits. She argues that spirit worship emerged in earliest times at the core of nativist (Shinto) beliefs.

The focus in this book is on using this part of the classroom day for resolving conflicts, coconstructing problem-solving strategies, and making the classroom a safe, positive environment so that children in preschools, kindergartens, and the primary grades can channel their energy into constructive interactions and learning.</p></p><p>Emily Vance, PhD, has more than 35 years&#39; experience teaching young children as well as college and university methods and education courses.The exciting thing about class meetings is that they are always different and unique, and they can vary according to time constraints, the children&#x2019;s concerns, and the teacher. From my experience, I became a believer in class meetings when I observed children beginning to use problem-solving strategies outside the meetings, depending less on adults, and using positive language with each other&#x2015;stepping-stones on the path to healthy self-esteem and respect for others. Class meetings help create a safe environment for everyone. These elements can transform a group of individual children into a real community of learners.</p><h2>The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code: Human Rights in Human Experimentation</h2><p>The atrocities committed by Nazi physicians and researchers during World War II prompted the development of the Nuremberg Code to define the ethics of modern medical experimentation utilizing human subjects. Since its enunciation, the Code has been viewed as one of the cornerstones of modern bioethical thought. The sources and ramifications of this important document are thoroughly discussed in this book by a distinguished roster of contemporary professionals from the fields of history, philosophy, medicine, and law. Contributors also include the chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg Military Tribunal and a moving account by a survivor of the Mengele Twin Experiments. The book sheds light on keenly debated issues of both science and jurisprudence, including the ethics of human experimentation; the doctrine of informed consent; and the Code's impact on today's international human rights agenda. The historical setting of the Code's creation, some modern parallels, and the current attitude of German physicians toward the crimes of the Nazi era, are discussed in early chapters. The book progresses to a powerful account of the Doctors' Trial at Nuremberg, its resulting verdict, and the Code's development. The Code's contemporary influence on both American and international law is examined in its historical context and discussed in terms of its universality: are the foundational ethics of the Code as valid today as when it was originally penned? The editors conclude with a chapter on foreseeable future developments and a proposal for an international covenant on human experimentation enforced by an international court. A major work in medical law and ethics, this volume provides stimulating, provocative reading for physicians, legal professionals, bioethicists, historians, biomedical researchers, and concerned laypersons.<br></p><p>George J.

By cleverly exploiting the memory of the Soviet victory over fascism in World War II, Putin's regime has made ordinary Russians feel that their country is great again. Walker not only explains Putin's goals and the government's official manipulations of history, but also focuses on ordinary Russians and their motivations. He charts how Putin raised victory in WWII to the status of a national founding myth in the search for a unifying force to heal a divided country, and shows how dangerous the ramifications of this have been. This book explores why Russia, unlike Germany, has failed to come to terms with the darkest pages of its past: Stalin's purges, the Gulag, and the war deportations. The narrative roams from the corridors of the Kremlin to the wilds of the Gulags and the trenches of East Ukraine. It puts the annexation of Crimea and the newly assertive Russia in the context of the delayed fallout of the Soviet collapse. The Long Hangover looks to a lost generation: the millions of Russians who lost their country and the subsequent attempts to restore to them a sense of purpose.<br></p><p><br><strong>Shaun Walker </strong>is a foreign correspondent for <em>The Guardian</em>. He was the paper's Moscow correspondent between 2013 and 2018 and worked as a journalist in Moscow for more than a decade. He studied Russian and Soviet history at Oxford University.<br><br>"Intelligent and ambitious, Walker's book succeeds in providing insight into the recent history of a nation at the center of world attention." -- <em>Publishers Weekly </em> <br><p></p><br>"The heroes of our age of postmodern myth are the investigative reporters. Shaun Walker has not only done the hard and necessary work of reporting from Russia and Ukraine, he has also reflected, with remarkable historical and literary sensibility, on what it means when a great power gives up on its own future and decides instead to market its past." -- Timothy Snyder, the Richard C. Levin Professor of History, Yale University, and author of <em>On Tyranny and Bloodlands</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Long Hangover</em> is thoughtful, brave, and full of insight. Anyone who wants to understand Russia now needs to read it." -- John Simpson, BBC News <br><p></p><br>"In this skillful and vivid book, Shaun Walker allows us to understand the region's current affairs through ordinary and extraordinary people's experience of an un-dealt with past." -- Peter Pomerantsev, author of <em>Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible</em><p></p><br>"This book has a very Russian feel to it. As with the best works of Russian literature, stories of ordinary people fold into the bigger picture. The characters cry, laugh, drink, fight, mourn, and celebrate all at once. Fear is mixed with hope, sorrow with pride, and things rarely end well. This is a deep, emotionally charged, and enthralling book that leaves a sad and bitter aftertaste." -- Elena Racheva, <em>Novaya Gazeta</em> <br><p></p><br>"[Walker] traveled to the faraway corners of the former Soviet Union and interviewed people whose voices are heard very rarely, especially in the West. The author must be a great listener and a careful interviewer to win the trust and confidence of all these individuals. He takes their stories seriously without dismissing their experiences." -- <em>Washington Post</em> <br><p></p><br>"The Long Hangover is considered and careful and humane, and should be compulsory reading for any politician considering engagement with either Moscow or Ukraine. It's not only the best book I've read on Putin's Russia, but also has great resonance for the age of Donald Trump and Brexit: no one likes being told they're a loser, everyone needs something to believe in." -- <em>The Guardian</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>American Homicide</h2><p>American Homicide examines all types of homicide, and gives additional attention to the more prevalent types of murder and suspicious deaths in the United States.

Now this classic history is being reissued, with a new foreword by acclaimed biographer Arnold Rampersad. <br><br>As Rampersad notes, "<em>Harlem Renaissance</em> remains an indispensable guide to the facts and features, the puzzles and mysteries, of one of the most provocative episodes in African-American and American history." Indeed, Huggins offers a brilliant account of the creative explosion in Harlem during these pivotal years. Blending the fields of history, literature, music, psychology, and folklore, he illuminates the thought and writing of such key figures as Alain Locke, James Weldon Johnson, and W.E.B. DuBois and provides sharp-eyed analyses of the poetry of Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, and Langston Hughes. But the main objective for Huggins, throughout the book, is always to achieve a better understanding of America as a whole. As Huggins himself noted, he didn't want Harlem in the 1920s to be the focus of the book so much as a lens through which readers might see how this one moment in time sheds light on the American character and culture, not just in Harlem but across the nation. He strives throughout to link the work of poets and novelists not only to artists working in other genres and media but also to economic, historical, and cultural forces in the culture at large.<br><br>This superb reissue of <em>Harlem Renaissance</em> brings to a new generation of readers one of the great works in African-American history and indeed a landmark work in the field of American Studies.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nathan Irvin Huggins</strong> was W.E.B.

They begin with the earliest extant literature, the Vedas, and the explanatory works that these inspired, known as Upanisads. They also discuss other famous texts of classical Vedic culture, especially the <em>Mahabharata</em> and its most notable section, the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em>, alongside the rise of Buddhism and Jainism. In this opening section, Adamson and Ganeri emphasize the way that philosophy was practiced as a form of life in search of liberation from suffering. <br><br>Next, the pair move on to the explosion of philosophical speculation devoted to foundational texts called 'sutras,' discussing such traditions as the logical and epistemological Nyaya school, the monism of Advaita Vedanta, and the spiritual discipline of Yoga. <br><br>In the final section of the book, they chart further developments within Buddhism, highlighting Nagarjuna's radical critique of 'non-dependent' concepts and the no-self philosophy of mind found in authors like Dignaga, and within Jainism, focusing especially on its 'standpoint' epistemology. Unlike other introductions that cover the main schools and positions in classical Indian philosophy, Adamson and Ganeri's lively guide also pays attention to philosophical themes such as non-violence, political authority, and the status of women, while considering textual traditions typically left out of overviews of Indian thought, like the Carvaka school, Tantra, and aesthetic theory as well. <br><br>Adamson and Ganeri conclude by focusing on the much-debated question of whether Indian philosophy may have influenced ancient Greek philosophy and, from there, evaluate the impact that this area of philosophy had on later Western thought.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Adamson </strong>received his BA from Williams College and PhD in Philosophy from the University of Notre Dame.

When this book was first published in 1978, Tobias's political and psychological analysis brought hope and made "math anxiety" a household expression.</strong></p> The new edition retains the author's pungent analysis of what makes math "hard" for otherwise successful people and how women, more than men, become victims of a gendered view of math. It has been substantially updated to incorporate new research on what we know and don't know about "sex differences" in brain organization and function, and it has been enlarged to include problems, puzzles, and strategies tried out in hundreds of math anxiety workshops Tobias and her colleagues have sponsored.<br><br> What remains unchanged is the author's politics. She sees "math anxiety" as a political issue. So long as people themselves to be disabled in mathematics and do not rise up and confront the social and pedagogical origins of their disabilities, they will be denied "math mental health." Tobias defines this as "the willingness to learn the math you need when you need it." In an ever more technical society, having that willingness can make the difference between high and low self-esteem, failure and success.</p><p>The new edition retains the author&#39;s pungent analysis of what makes math &#34;hard&#34; for otherwise successful people and how women, more than men, become victims of a gendered view of math.

It is not for us to fix or change the person with same-sex attractions; our place is simply to love them. Just like anyone else, people with same-sex attractions first need to hear that their heavenly Father cares for them. Prosen reminds us of the power of affirming love in our own experience. When someone takes the time to just be with us and tells us the truth in a compassionate way, we are more likely to receive it. Each of us, then, as spiritual mothers and fathers, may be a vehicle for Christ's affirming love shining in the loneliness of same-sex attractions." - Suzanne Baars, PhD, Catholic psychotherapist and founder of the Baars Institute</p> <p>"David Prosen has written a powerful booklet that I wish every Catholic adult would read. With incredible authenticity and transparency, he takes the reader into the interior reality - so often marked by wounds and pain - of those who experience same-sex attraction. Yet he also points the way to hope and healing in Christ, and the ways the Body of Christ can be a source of healing. This book will change the way you see the world." - Dr. John Bergsma, PhD, Catholic Bible scholar, author, speaker</p> <p>"With compassion and honesty, David Prosen reveals an empowering vision for sharing the liberating love of Jesus Christ with men and women trapped in the culture's false messaging and still longing for authentic love." - Lisa Mladinich, host of Shalom World TV's WOMAN: Strong Faith, True Beauty</p> <p>About the Author David Prosen is a graduate of Franciscan University of Steubenville with an MA in counseling. He has worked as a counselor in both secular and Catholic settings, treating many different conditions, including depression, anxiety, and more. David was featured in Blackstone's film The Third Way: Homosexuality and the Catholic Church and has had several articles published in Lay Witness, Crisis Magazine and LifeSiteNews.

Sorry is one of those wonderful games that is easy even for young children to master, but often difficult for the most mature of adults to tolerate. You can be so close to Home, and be bumped so precipitously by your opponent all the way back to Start. Positions shift quickly. The sure winner loses and the loser triumphs.</p><p>Stephanie whoops loudly as she beats me for the third time. Each time she bumps one of my pieces back to Start, she croons "Sooorrryyy" with considerably more delight than remorse. I glance at the clock and let her know that we are close to being out of time. We pack up the box and she places it back on the shelf. I stand up. Without warning, my slip drops to the floor and lands on my shoes. We both stare at it, stunned. I stammer, "Oh my goodness!"</p><p>Stephanie, a rather solemn child, is seized with paroxysms of laughter, which become contagious. I step out of my slip and stuff it into my briefcase. Stephanie tries to catch her breath and exclaims, "My perfect Dr. Manning is coming apart!"</p><p>She bursts into the crowded waiting room and graphically describes the scene to her parents. It is clear that the entire waiting room enjoys this story. I can see them smiling and smirking behind their <i>Ladies Home Journals </i>and <i>National Geographics</i>. My friend Ed passes me in the hall between our offices and asks casually, "That wouldn't be your Freudian slip, would it?"</p><p><br></p><p><i>January 8, 1990</i><br></p><p>My desk is littered with too many things that are getting too little attention. Papers wait passively in the "to do" pile. They've been there so long they are beginning to discolor. Four Diet Coke bottles sit half-filled with warm flat brown liquid. A crusty coffee cup holds the remnants of old candy bars, abandoned midway in fits of guilt. The phone bill is two months overdue and three Medicare forms are screaming for attention. I've been so busy lately, I've started a "to read" pile for the mail I have yet to open. Each evening I leave the office with the magical thought that the night will bring order to the chaos and transform it all by morning. But that is like shoving the box of aluminum foil back into the haphazardly organized closet and closing the door quickly, before it can slide back out. I always hope that time will somehow settle the contents of the closet, and I'm always surprised the next time I open the door when the package slides right back out and smacks me in the head.</p><p>I picture a woman who has it all together. She processes things completely the first time they cross her desk. She is up-to-date with bills, Pap smears, and teeth cleanings. She knows that her children's drawers are filled with clean, folded clothes. She knows what her family will be having for dinner three days in advance. She is complete. Able to go to sleep each night without the weight of any old business on the agenda. Everything on her list is crossed off. I hate her.</p><p><br></p><p><i>January 9, 1990</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>I am on a blitz. A week ago I heard about the National Institutes of Health offering grants for beginning researchers. Since then, it has been constant and frenetic activity: liaison with the grants office, designing the study, estimating budgets, getting endorsements, consultations, statistical input. I'm on my second day of no sleep and I actually feel great. I'm running on fumes with the nutritional support of Diet Coke, coffee, and Hostess powdered-sugar doughnuts. In the middle of the night, hunched over my computer, with the rest of the house dark and quiet, I feel a certain moral superiority to the sleeping world. Even with all this effort, I'm not sure the proposal will be finished by the deadline. But my foot is on the accelerator and I plan to push it to the floor. That's never failed me yet.</p><p><br></p><p><i>January 12,1990</i><br></p><p></p><p>The grant proposal gets in, with three minutes to spare before the 5:00 P.m. deadline. The department chair dispatches a lab assistant to hand-deliver it to NIH. As we madly collate and staple, I notice a typo and almost start to cry. But it is too late for changes. I whip off a cover letter, pack the damn thing, and send the lab assistant on his mission, encouraging him to consider all speed limits and stoplights as suggested guidelines rather than rigid driving rules. He promises to call me the minute the package is stamped "Received."</p><p>For the next hour I put in my time as academic adviser to the parade of students outside my office. I jump when the phone rings. The lab assistant tells me he got it in just under the wire. I thank him profusely and promise that I will never push a proposal to the limit like that again. Before the words fully leave my mouth, I'm aware that I am lying.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p><i>January 14,1990</i><br></p><p></p><p>There is something about flying through time, as I have over the past week, that makes me think that I am exempted from the laws of gravity. But the way I feel today lets me know that I'm not. I have done another of the crash-and-burns that are the price for my blitzes. I am grounded, heavy, and slow. I have overdosed on effort, and the hangover is horrible. I guess this is what I get for flying too close to the sun.

Each of these discussed the various attributes of healing that underpin homeopathy as a method of curing. The notion of 'miasms' as the origin and cause of all chronic disease, and how such can be alleviated, is elaborated upon by the author.</p><p> </p><p>Today, homeopathy has been widely discredited, with its methodology and teachings contrasted with established discoveries in biology and chemistry. Numerous studies of homeopathy's efficacy have shown that the results of treatment are no better than placebo. In the 19th century however, its use was popular with Hahnemann himself contrasting his methods by terming conventional medicine 'allopathic'.</p><p> </p><p>This edition combines side-by-side two editions of the Organon; the fifth, translated in late 19th century by R.

She's surrounded by Catholics--but she's Methodist! Shunned by the other boarders, Lizzy befriends a wandering carpenter named Jos�, who with just three tools--and unflagging faith--builds an elaborate spiral staircase in the new chapel in mere weeks. When he disappears without a trace, Lizzy realizes that the way she sees things is not always the way they are.<br> Inspired by the legend of the "miraculous" staircase in the Chapel of Loretto in Santa Fe, Ann Rinaldi skillfully blends the mystery surrounding the staircase's builder with the daily trials of a spunky thirteen-year-old girl growing up in the 1870s.<br></p><p>"'This one is wise,' he said.' This one has an old spirit. She has been among us before.'" Though the Arapaho Indian on the trail praised her old spirit, 14-year-old Lizzy Enders feels anything but wise. Within only a few days, she has lost her mother to the fever, been left by her widowed father at a convent, and thrust into the strange world of the Academy of Our Lady of Light in 1870s Santa Fe. Born a Methodist, Lizzy just can't comprehend Catholicism: "All this talk of blood and martyrdom and eating flesh and agony. It was just all too much, is all." In an attempt to alleviate her misery, Lizzy befriends an unemployed elderly carpenter and suggests he be hired to build the missing staircase for the convent's new chapel. The other girls at the academy are furious, since they have been praying for a miracle to complete the stairs, not an old beggar. Can she convince them that this aged man, with his real tools, is better than an ephemeral miracle? What Lizzy has to discover for herself is that sometimes miracles come disguised in nun's habits... or carpenter's sandals.<p> Based on a legend of a real chapel stairway in Santa Fe, <i>The Staircase</i> is a lively historical fiction that successfully merges myth, religion, and old-fashioned pioneer sensibility. Lizzy's need to make order of her chaotic world and define the unknown are timeless teen traits, making <i>The Staircase</i> a historical novel with real relevance for today's adolescent.

The resulting strain of popular apologetics&#x2015;which weaves through Lewis into twentieth-century writers like Francis Schaeffer and modern apologists like William Lane Craig, Josh McDowell, and Lee Strobel&#x2015;has equipped countless believers to defend their faith against its detractors.</p><p><em>Apologetics for the Twenty-first Century</em> uses Lewis&#x2019;s work as the starting point for an absorbing survey of the key apologists and major arguments that inform apologetics today. Like apologists before him, Markos writes to engage Christians of all denominations as well as seekers and skeptics.

But an extensive and heavily annotated bibliography, detailed timeline, list of prominent apologists, and glossary of common terms will satisfy the curiosity of the seasoned academic, as the book prepares all readers to meet the particular challenges of defending the faith today.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Louis Markos</strong> (PhD, University of Michigan) is professor of English and scholar in residence at Houston Baptist University. He is the author of twelve books and has published over 120 book chapters, essays, and reviews in various magazines and journals. He lives in Houston with his wife, Donna, and their two children.</p><p>Professor of English and Scholar in Residence, Houston Baptist University; author, <em>From Achilles to Christ </em>and<em> Literature: A Student&#x2019;s Guide</em></p><p>&#x201c;Providing an overview of almost a century of Christian apologetics, Lou Markos&#x2019;s volume <em>Apologetics for the Twenty-first Century</em> moves all the way from G. K. Chesterton and C. S. Lewis to postmodernism, the New Atheists, and former atheist Antony Flew&#x2019;s newly found belief in the existence of God. Covering the relevant authors as well as their ideas and works, Markos writes in a popular, highly readable style that could be viewed as a conversational journey through each of these topics. Those interested in apologetics will find several major items of significance in this far-reaching and fast-paced text.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gary R. Habermas,</strong>&nbsp;Distinguished Research Professor and Chair, Department of Philosophy, Liberty University</p><p>&#x201c;This is a terrific book. I&#x2019;ve read hundreds of books on the defense of the faith in recent years, and this is a stand out. Professor Markos uniquely weaves together theology, literature, history, science, and philosophy to produce a work of apologetics that is both erudite and thoroughly accessible. I enjoyed every page of it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Craig J. Hazen</strong>, Professor of Comparative Religion, Biola University</p><p>&#x201c;It is in some ways shocking that every generation of Christians has to remind the broader culture that we in fact have arguments and reasons for our faith. But given the cultural hegemony and intellectual ubiquity of atheistic materialism and the way it has shaped our understanding of the good, the true, and the beautiful, it should not surprise us that our antagonists want to maintain that faith and reason are adversaries rather than, as John Paul II put it, &#x2018;like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth.&#x2019; <em>Apologetics for the Twenty-first Century</em> is a readable antidote to a conventional wisdom that is indeed conventional but not wise.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Francis J. Beckwith</strong>, Professor of Philosophy and Church-State Studies, Baylor University; author,&nbsp;<em>Defending Life: A Moral and Legal Case Against Abortion Choice</em></p><p>&#x201c;Lou Markos has joined the top rank of commentators on the work of C. S. Lewis and is a powerful apologist for the Christian faith in his own right. His command of the two great streams of Western thought&#x2015;Christianity and classics&#x2015;has enabled him to develop a winsome, sophisticated, and convincing body of work.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Robert B. Sloan Jr.</strong>, President, Houston Baptist University</p><p>&#x201c;Happily, the discipline of apologetics is having something of a renaissance today. In the mix, it would make no sense to neglect the considerable significance of C. S. Lewis. He brought about a great resurgence of interest in the defense of the faith. Louis Markos has done us a great service by posting Lewis&#x2019;s work in dialogue with the issues of the day, some which were surely contemporaneous with the Oxford pundit and some coming to prominence a bit later, though still issues he would have enjoyed engaging. This volume will help readers see how Lewis would have dealt with the issues of our day. In the end, it will remind readers of the vitality of the claim that the Christian faith is true.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>William Edgar,</strong> Professor of Apologetics, Westminster Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Louis Markos is the Platonic form of the Christian college professor. His love of the Scriptures and his broad mastery of the Western tradition of the humanities makes him the model for a new generation of apologists rising from the universities. His lectures have been a great success with students young and old at the university and with the global audience of The Teaching Company. Readers will discover he is just as delightful in print as he is when roaming the front of a classroom.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Hunter Baker</strong>, Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences, Union University; author, <em>The End of Secularism</em></p><p>&#x201c;Louis Markos has proved once again that he is one of today's foremost Christian apologists. Writing with the eloquence and accessibility that characterizes the work of his mentor, C. S. Lewis, he makes the rational case for faith with potency and aplomb. Mirroring the Bible in its structure, <em>Apologetics for the Twenty-first Century</em> begins with an &#x201c;old testament&#x201d; (part 1) in which the works of those latter-day prophets, Chesterton, Lewis, and Sayers, lay the foundation for the &#x201c;new testament&#x201d; (part 2) in which today's apologists defy and defeat the &#x201c;new atheists&#x201d; and other fashionable dragons. <em>Apologetics for the Twenty-first Century</em> shows Markos to be a twenty-first century apologist of the first and highest order.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joseph Pearce,</strong> Writer in Residence and Associate Professor of Literature, Ave Maria University; author, <em>Through Shakespeare's Eyes</em> and <em>Literary Converts</em></p><p>&#x201c;Drawing on the rich resources of leading twentieth-century apologists, Louis Markos has crafted a brilliant work of Christian defense. Like Lewis and Chesterton before him, Markos uses his literary wit and scholarly precision to capture both heart and mind as he presents Christian arguments and evidences. Whether you are a skeptic, seeker, or solid believer, your faith will grow as you read this book!&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Chad V.

His novella <i>We Are All Completely Fine</i> won the World Fantasy Award and the Shirley Jackson Award. He lives in Oakland, California.<p>1</p><p>Matty</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matty Telemachus left his body for the first time in the summer of 1995, when he was fourteen years old. Or maybe it&#x2019;s more accurate to say that his body expelled him, sending his consciousness flying on a geyser of lust and shame.</p><p>Just before it happened, he was kneeling in a closet, one sweaty hand pressed to the chalky drywall, his right eye lined up with the hole at the back of an unwired electrical outlet box. On the other side of the wall was his cousin Mary Alice and her chubby white-blonde friend. Janice? Janelle? Probably Janelle. The girls&#x2014;both two years older than him, juniors, <i>women</i>&#x2014;lay on the bed side by side, propped up on their elbows, facing in his direction. Janelle wore a spangled T-shirt, but Mary Alice&#x2014;who the year before had announced that she would respond only to &#x201c;Malice&#x201d;&#x2014;wore an oversized red flannel shirt that hung off her shoulder. His eye was drawn to the gaping neck of the shirt, following that swell of skin down down down into shadow. He was pretty sure she was wearing a black bra.</p><p>They were looking at a school yearbook while listening to Mary Alice&#x2019;s CD Walkman, sharing foam headphones&nbsp; between them like a wishbone. Matty couldn&#x2019;t hear the music, but even if he could, it was probably no band <i>he&#x2019;d </i>heard of. Someone calling herself Malice&nbsp;wouldn&#x2019;t tolerate anything popular. Once she&#x2019;d caught him humming Hootie &amp; the Blowfish and the look of scorn on her face made his throat close.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t seem to like him as a matter of policy, even though he had proof that she once did: a Christmas Polaroid of a four-year-old Mary Alice, beaming, with her brown arms wrapped around his white toddler body. But in the six months since Matty and his mom had moved back to Chicago and into Grandpa Teddy&#x2019;s house, he&#x2019;d seen Mary Alice practically every other week, and she&#x2019;d barely spoken to him. He tried to match her cool and pretend she wasn&#x2019;t in the room. Then she&#x2019;d walk past, sideswiping him with the scent of bubblegum and cigarettes, and the rational part of his brain would swerve off the road and crash into a tree.</p><p>Out of desperation, he set down three commandments for himself:</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;If your cousin is in the room, do not try to look down her shirt. It&#x2019;s creepy. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Do not have lustful thoughts about your cousin. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Under no circumstances should you touch yourself while having lustful thoughts about your cousin.<p>So far tonight the first two had gone down in flames, and the third was in the crosshairs. The adults (except for Uncle Buddy, who never really left the house anymore) had all gone downtown for din- ner, someplace fancy, evidently, with his mom in her interview skirt, Uncle Frankie looking like a real estate agent with a jacket over a golf shirt, and Frankie&#x2019;s wife, Aunt Loretta, squeezed into a lavender pant- suit. Grandpa Teddy, of course, wore a suit and the Hat (in Matty&#x2019;s mind, &#x201c;Hat&#x201d; was always capitalized). But even that uniform had been upgraded slightly for the occasion: gold cuff links, a decorative hand- kerchief poking up out of his breast pocket, his fanciest, diamond- studded wristwatch. They&#x2019;d be back so late that Frankie&#x2019;s kids were supposed to sleep over. Uncle Frankie mixed a gallon of powdered Goji Go! berry juice, placed a twenty-dollar bill with some ceremony next to the jug, and addressed his daughters. &#x201c;I want change,&#x201d; he said to Mary Alice. Then he pointed to the twins: &#x201c;And you guys, try not to burn down the fucking house, all right?&#x201d; Polly and Cassie, seven years old, appeared not to hear him.</p><p>Uncle Buddy was technically in charge, but the cousins all under- stood that they were on their own for the evening. Buddy was in his own world, a high-gravity planet he left only with great difficulty. He worked on his projects, he marked off the days on the refrigerator cal- endar in pink crayon, and he spoke to as few people as possible. He wouldn&#x2019;t even answer the door for the pizza guy; it was Matty who went to the door with the twenty, and who set the two dollars&#x2019; change very carefully in the middle of the table.</p><p>Through some carefully timed choreography, Matty managed to outmaneuver Janelle-the-interloper and the twins to score the chair next to Mary Alice. He spent all of dinner next to her, hyperaware of every centimeter that separated his hand from hers.</p><p>Buddy took one piece of pizza and vanished to the basement, and the high whine of the band saw was all they heard of him for hours. Buddy, a bachelor who&#x2019;d lived his entire life in this house with Grandpa Teddy, was forever starting projects&#x2014;tearing down, roughing in, tack- ing up&#x2014;but never finishing.</p><p>Like the partially deconstructed room Matty was hiding in. Until recently it and the adjoining room were part of an unfinished attic. Buddy had removed the old insulation, framed in closets, wired up lights, installed beds in both rooms&#x2014;and then had moved on. This half of the attic was technically Matty&#x2019;s bedroom, but most of the closet was filled with old clothes. Buddy seemed to have forgotten the clothes and the empty electrical sockets behind them.</p><p>Matty, however, had not forgotten.</p><p>Janelle turned a page of the yearbook and laughed. &#x201c;Ooh! Your lover!&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; Mary Alice said. Her dark hair hung across her eyes in a way that knocked him out.</p><p>&#x201c;You want that big thing in your mouth, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Janelle asked. Matty&#x2019;s thighs were cramping, but he wasn&#x2019;t about to move now. &#x201c;Shut the fuck up,&#x201d; &nbsp;Mary Alice &nbsp;said. She &nbsp;bumped &nbsp;her &nbsp;friend&#x2019;s</p><p>shoulder. Janelle rolled into her, laughing, and when the girls righted themselves, the flannel shirt had slipped from his cousin&#x2019;s shoulder, exposing a black bra strap.</p><p>No: a <i>dark purple </i>bra strap.</p><p>Commandment #3, Thou shalt not touch thyself, began to smol- der and smoke.</p><p>Twenty feverish seconds later, Matty&#x2019;s back arched as if yanked by a hot wire. An ocean roar filled his ears.</p><p>Suddenly he was in the air, the studs of the slanted ceiling inches from his face. He shouted, but he had no voice. He tried to push away from the ceiling, but realized he didn&#x2019;t have arms, either. In fact, no body at all.</p><p>After a moment, his vision swiveled, but he felt no control over that movement; a camera panning on its own. The floor of the room swung into view. His body had fallen out of the closet and lay stretched out on the plywood.</p><p><i>That&#x2019;s </i>what he looked like? That chubby belly, that pimply jawline? The body&#x2019;s eyes fluttered open, and for a vertiginous moment Matty was both the watcher and the watched. The body&#x2019;s mouth opened in&nbsp;shock, and then&#x2014;</p><p>It was as if the strings holding him aloft were suddenly cut. Matty plummeted. The body screamed: a high-pitched, girlish squeal he had time to register as deeply embarrassing. Then consciousness and flesh crashed into each other.</p><p>He bounced around inside his body like a Super Ball. When the reverberations settled, he was looking out through his eyes at the ceil- ing, which was now the appropriate distance away.</p><p>Thumps sounded from the next room. The girls! They&#x2019;d heard him!</p><p>He jumped up, covering his crotch like a wounded soldier. &#x201c;Matty?&#x201d; Malice called. The door began to swing open.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay! I&#x2019;m okay!&#x201d; he shouted. He launched himself into the closet.</p><p>From somewhere the blonde laughed. Mary Alice appeared at the closet doors, hands on her hips. &#x201c;What are you doing in here?&#x201d;</p><p>He looked up at her, the bottom half of his body covered by wom- en&#x2019;s apparel, the topmost dress an orange striped number that looked very seventies.</p><p>&#x201c;I tripped,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Okay . . .&#x201d;</p><p>He made no move to get up.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d; Mary Alice asked. She&#x2019;d seen something in his expression.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; &nbsp;he &nbsp;said. &nbsp;He&#x2019;d &nbsp;just &nbsp;had &nbsp;a &nbsp;bad &nbsp;thought: These are&nbsp;Grandma Mo&#x2019;s dresses. I&#x2019;ve just despoiled my dead grandmother&#x2019;s clothes.</p><p>He propped himself on an elbow. Trying to look comfortable, as if he&#x2019;d just discovered that twenty-year-old frocks made the perfect bed- ding material.</p><p>Mary Alice started to say something, then she glanced at the wall behind him, just over his shoulder. Her eyes narrowed. Through force of will, Matty did not turn around to see if she was looking at the empty electrical box.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay then,&#x201d; she said. She backed away from the closet. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Thanks. All good.&#x201d;</p><p>The girls left the room, and he immediately turned and covered the hole in the wall with the orange gown. He began to rehang the dresses and coats: a waist-length rabbit fur coat, a bunch of knee-length skirts, a plaid raincoat. One of the last items was covered in a clear plastic dry-cleaning bag. It was a long, shimmery silver dress, and the sight of it rang chimes somewhere far back in his brain.</p><p>Oh, he thought. That&#x2019;s right. It&#x2019;s what Grandma Mo wore on the videotape. <i>The </i>videotape.</p><p>Uncle Frankie had shown Matty the tape at Thanksgiving four years ago. Frankie had been drinking a lot of red wine, hitting it hard as soon as his wife, Loretta, unwrapped the shrimp cocktail appetizers, and his sentences had turned <i>emphatic </i>and <i>urgent. </i>He was railing about some guy named the Astounding Archibald, who&#x2019;d ruined <i>everything.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Think what we could&#x2019;ve had,&#x201d; Frankie said. &#x201c;We could have been kings.&#x201d;</p><p>Irene, Matty&#x2019;s mom, laughed, making Frankie scowl. &#x201c;Kings of what?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>Irene and Matty had driven in from Pittsburgh the night before, and they&#x2019;d woken up to find that Grandpa Teddy had bought a bird and not much else; he&#x2019;d been waiting for his daughter to conjure the rest of the meal. Now that they were finally on the other side of dinner, the table turned into a postcombat battlefield: pumpkin pie destroyed,</p><p>Rice Krispies Treats in ruins, all wine bottles depleted. Matty was the last kid left in his chair. He&#x2019;d always liked hanging out with the adults. Most of the time he stayed under the radar, not speaking, in the hope that they&#x2019;d forget he was there and start saying interesting things.</p><p>&#x201c;That no-talent hack just couldn&#x2019;t stand to see us win,&#x201d; Frankie said.</p><p>&#x201c;No, he was a talented man, a talented man,&#x201d; Grandpa Teddy said from the head of the table. &#x201c;Brilliant, even. But shortsighted.&#x201d; As usual, he was the most dressed-up person in the house. Shiny black suit, pink shirt, riotous paisley tie as wide as a trout. Grandpa always dressed like he was about to go to a wedding or a funeral, except in the mornings or just before bed, when he walked around as if he were alone in the house: wife-beater T-shirt, boxer shorts, black socks. He didn&#x2019;t seem to own &#x201c;sportswear&#x201d; or &#x201c;work clothes,&#x201d; maybe because he never did sports and didn&#x2019;t work. He was rich, though. Irene said she didn&#x2019;t know where the money came from, but Matty imagined it was all poker win- nings. Grandpa Teddy, it was understood, was the greatest cardshark of all time. He taught Matty seven-card stud, sitting at the kitchen table for hours until Matty&#x2019;s pennies ran out. (Grandpa Teddy always played for money, and never gave it back after a game. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t sharpen your knife on a sponge,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, scripture that Matty believed in without entirely understanding.)</p><p>&#x201c;Archibald was a necessary evil,&#x201d; Grandpa Teddy said. &#x201c;He was the voice of the skeptic. If your mother had shown him up, the audience would have loved us for it. We could have gone to the stratosphere with that act.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was evil,&#x201d; Frankie said. &#x201c;A damn liar and a cheat! He wouldn&#x2019;t take Communion without palming the wafer.&#x201d;</p><p>Grandpa Teddy chuckled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all water under the bridge now.&#x201d; &#x201c;He was just plain jealous,&#x201d; Frankie said. &#x201c;He hated our gifts. He&nbsp;wanted to destroy us.&#x201d;</p><p>Matty couldn&#x2019;t stand it any longer. He had to ask. &#x201c;What did this guy do to us?&#x201d;</p><p>Frankie leaned across the table, looking Matty straight in the eye. &#x201c;What did he <i>do</i>?&#x201d; he said in a low, emotion-choked voice. &#x201c;He killed Grandma Mo, that&#x2019;s what.&#x201d;</p><p>A thrill went through Matty. It wasn&#x2019;t just this dramatic declara- tion; it was the electricity of being noticed by his uncle. Of being seen.</p><p>Uncle Frankie had always been kind to Matty, but he&#x2019;d never talked to him as if he mattered.</p><p>&#x201c;Can we drop this, please?&#x201d; Irene asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He did kill her,&#x201d; Frankie said, leaning back but keeping his eyes on Matty. &#x201c;Sure as if he&#x2019;d put a gun to her head.&#x201d;</p><p>Matty&#x2019;s mom frowned. &#x201c;You believe that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Frankie swiveled his head to stare her down. &#x201c;Yes, Irene. Yes, I do.&#x201d; Loretta got to her feet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going for a smoke.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll join you,&#x201d; Grandpa Teddy said. He rose from the table, straightened his cuffs, and took her arm.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not supposed to smoke, Dad,&#x201d; Irene said. &#x201c;Loretta&#x2019;s smoking,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m secondary smoking.&#x201d;</p><p>Uncle Frankie gestured to Matty. &#x201c;Come on, it&#x2019;s time you saw something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not doing these dishes alone,&#x201d; Irene said.</p><p>&#x201c;Have Buddy help you.&#x201d; He slapped his brother on the shoulder&#x2014;a little too hard, Matty thought. Buddy&#x2019;s eyes fluttered, but his gaze never moved from the middle distance. He had a way of sitting very still, slumping lower and lower, as if he were turning to pudding.</p><p>&#x201c;Leave him alone,&#x201d; Irene said.</p><p>Buddy remained unperturbed. He&#x2019;d been in one of his trances since finishing his pie, staring into space, occasionally smiling to himself or silently mouthing a word or two. His muteness was a mystery to Matty, and the adults wouldn&#x2019;t talk about it, a double silence that was impen- etrable. Matty&#x2019;s mom would only give him variations of &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way he is.&#x201d; Once Matty worked up the courage to ask Grandpa Teddy about why Buddy hardly spoke, and he said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to ask him.&#x201d;</p><p>Frankie led Matty to the front room, where a huge console televi- sion was parked against the wall like a Chrysler. His uncle dropped heavily onto his butt&#x2014;holding his wineglass aloft and managing to keep most of the wine inside it&#x2014;and opened up one of the cabinets.</p><p>&#x201c;Now we&#x2019;re talking,&#x201d; Frankie said. A VHS machine sat on a shelf, and in the space below was a jumble of videocassettes. He pulled one out, squinted at the label, and tossed it aside. He started working his way through the stack. &#x201c;I gave Dad a copy,&#x201d; he said under his breath. &#x201c;Unless Buddy threw it out, that fuckin&#x2019;&#x2014;hey. Here we go.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a black cassette box with orange stripes. Frankie ejected the current tape from the machine and jammed in the one from the box.</p><p>&#x201c;This is our history,&#x201d; Frankie said. He turned on the television. &#x201c;This is your heritage.&#x201d;</p><p>On the screen, a store clerk madly squeezed rolls of toilet paper.</p><p>Frankie pressed play on the VCR, and nothing happened. &#x201c;You have to turn it to channel three,&#x201d; Matty said.</p><p>&#x201c;Right, right.&#x201d; The TV&#x2019;s dial was missing, exposing a naked prong. Frankie reached up to retrieve the set of needle-nose pliers Grandpa Teddy kept on top of the console. &#x201c;That was my first job. Grandpa&#x2019;s remote control.&#x201d;</p><p>The tape had the swimmy look of something recorded off broad- cast TV. A talk show host in suit and tie sat on a cramped set, with a brilliant yellow wall behind him. &#x201c;&#x2014;and they&#x2019;ve been thrilling audi- ences around the country,&#x201d; he was saying. &#x201c;Please welcome Teddy Telemach...</p></p><h2>Maria Callas: The Woman behind the Legend</h2><p>For millions of people, the great soprano Maria Callas (1923-1977) remains the focus of such unparalleled fascination that there is still no higher praise for singers than &#34;...the best since Callas.&#34; In this biography, Callas&#39; career is brought brilliantly to life, from her transformation from a chubby, painfully shy girl into a magnificent, celebrated soprano, to her conflict with her larger-than-life image. Huffington makes this struggle, which was at the center of her life, also the center of the biography. Using a wealth of previously unpublished material and numerous first-hand interviews, Huffington documents Callas&#39; interminable conflict with her mother, her deeply emotional relationship with her voice, the gradual unraveling of her first marriage, her passionate love affair with of Aristotle Onassis, her agony and humiliation at his leaving her, and her secret abortion.</p><p>Arianna Huffington, a nationally syndicated columnist and author of <i>Picasso</i>, <i>How to Overthrow the Government</i>, and <i>The Fourth Instinct</i>, divides her time between Los Angeles and Washington, D. C.The most readable and by far the most illuminating biography to date of Callas the woman...Compulsive and convincing reading (<i>The Times (UK), (London)</i>)<br><br>The author has entered the complex and contradictory mind of Maria Callas in an extraordinary way, and the result is a powerful story told movingly yet without exaggeration. It is unquestionably an important book, and surely the finest biography of Callas ever written.

He also happens to have a Ph.D. in zoology and wrote his dissertation on evolution, atheism and naturalism. Preston Jones is a history professor at a Christian college and a fan of Bad Religion's music. One day, on a whim, Preston sent Greg an appreciative e-mail. That was the start of an extraordinary correspondence. For several months, Preston and Greg sent e-mails back and forth on big topics like God, religion, knowledge, evil, evolution, biology, destiny and the nature of reality. Preston believes in God; Greg sees insufficient evidence for God's existence. Over the course of their friendly debate, they tackle such cosmic questions as: Is religion rational or irrational? Does morality require belief in God? Do people only believe in God because they are genetically predisposed toward religion? How do you make sense of suffering in the world? Is this universe all there is? And what does it all matter? In this engaging book, Preston and Greg's actual e-mail correspondence is reproduced, along with bonus materials that provide additional background and context.

In this amazing book, he offers an account of his own incredible flights of "soul travel"--and shows us how we too can develop this life-changing ability.</p><p>Albert Taylor gives us his honest and very personal account of how he escaped his nightly fears of sleep paralysis to soar consciously through the astral plane. Some call this astral travel, or an out-of-body experience, but Taylor calls it "soul travel." His term eloquently embodies his philosophy that we are actually powerful, spiritual beings in the midst of a human experience, rather than human beings having minor spiritual experiences. Despite Taylor's background as a NASA engineer, <i>Soul Traveler</i> is far from a technical manual. Reading it is like having an engaging conversation about astral travel with a friend. Along with some simple advice for inducing and controlling our own out-of-body experiences, Taylor shares the encouraging insights about the spiritual nature of human beings that he has gleaned from a remarkable experience he once viewed as an affliction. <i>--Brian Patterson</i>The author relates his spiritual travels with wit and humor making his journal reachable and enjoyable.

In 2017, she received the Order of Canada for her contributions to Canadian culture. Louise lives in a small village south of Montr�al.ONE<br>Up the stairs they raced, taking them two at a time, trying to be as quiet as possible. Gamache struggled to keep his breathing steady, as though he was sitting at home, as though he had not a care in the world.<br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; came the young voice over Gamache&#x2019;s headphones.<br>&#x201c;You must believe me, son. Nothing bad will happen to you.&#x201d;<br>He hoped the young agent couldn&#x2019;t hear the strain in his voice, the flattening as the Chief Inspector fought to keep his voice authoritative, certain.<br>&#x201c;I believe you.&#x201d;<br>They reached the landing. Inspector Beauvoir stopped, staring at his Chief. Gamache looked at his watch.<br>47 seconds.<br>Still time.<br>In his headphones the agent was telling him about the sunshine and how good it felt on his face.<br>The rest of the team made the landing, tactical vests in place, automatic weapons drawn, eyes sharp. Trained on the Chief. Beside him Inspector Beauvoir was also waiting for a decision. Which way? They were close. Within feet of their quarry.<br>Gamache stared down one dark, dingy corridor in the abandoned factory then down the other.<br>They looked identical. Light scraped through the broken, grubby windows lining the halls and with it came the December day.<br>43 seconds.<br>He pointed decisively to the left and they ran, silently, toward the door at the end. As he ran Gamache gripped his rifle and spoke calmly into the headset.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need to worry.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s forty seconds left, sir.&#x201d; Each word was exhaled as though the man on the other end was having difficulty breathing.<br>&#x201c;Just listen to me,&#x201d; said Gamache, thrusting his hand toward a door. The team surged ahead.<br>36 seconds.<br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let anything happen to you,&#x201d; said Gamache, his voice convincing, commanding, daring the young agent to contradict. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be having dinner with your family tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes sir.&#x201d;<br>The tactical team surrounded the closed door with its frosted, filthy window. Darkened.<br>Gamache paused, staring at it, his hand hanging in the air ready to give the signal to break it down. To rescue his agent.<br>29 seconds.<br>Beside him Beauvoir strained, waiting to be loosed.<br>Too late, Chief Inspector Gamache realized he&#x2019;d made a mistake.<br>&#x201c;Give it time, Armand.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Avec le temps?&#x201d; Gamache returned the older man&#x2019;s smile and made a fist of his right hand. To stop the trembling. A tremble so slight he was certain the waitress in the Quebec City caf� hadn&#x2019;t noticed. The two students across the way tapping on their laptops wouldn&#x2019;t notice. No one would notice.<br>Except someone very close to him.<br>He looked at �mile Comeau, crumbling a flaky croissant with sure hands. He was nearing eighty now, Gamache&#x2019;s mentor and former chief. His hair was white and groomed, his eyes through his glasses a sharp blue. He was slender and energetic, even now. Though with each visit Armand Gamache noticed a slight softening about the face, a slight slowing of the movements.<br>Avec le temps.<br>Widowed five years, �mile Comeau knew the power, and length, of time.<br>Gamache&#x2019;s own wife, Reine-Marie, had left at dawn that morning after spending a week with them at �mile&#x2019;s stone home within the old walled city of Qu�bec. They&#x2019;d had quiet dinners together in front of the fire, they&#x2019;d walked the narrow snow-covered streets. Talked. Were silent. Read the papers, discussed events. The three of them. Four, if you counted their German shepherd, Henri.<br>And most days Gamache had gone off on his own to a local library, to read.<br>�mile and Reine-Marie had given him that, recognizing that right now he needed society but he also needed solitude.<br>And then it was time for her to leave. After saying good-bye to �mile she turned to her husband. Tall, solid, a man who preferred good books and long walks to any other activity, he looked more like a distinguished professor in his mid-fifties than the head of the most prestigious hom icide unit in Canada. The S�ret� du Qu�bec. He walked her to her car, scraping the morning ice from the windshield.<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to go, you know,&#x201d; he said, smiling down at her as they stood in the brittle, new day. Henri sat in a snow bank nearby and watched.<br>&#x201c;I know. But you and �mile need time together. I could see how you were looking at each other.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The longing?&#x201d; laughed the Chief Inspector. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d hoped we&#x2019;d been more discreet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A wife always knows.&#x201d; She smiled, looking into his deep brown eyes. He wore a hat, but still she could see his graying hair, and the slight curl where it came out from under the fabric. And his beard. She&#x2019;d slowly become used to the beard. For years he&#x2019;d had a moustache, but just lately, since it happened, he&#x2019;d grown the trim beard.<br>She paused. Should she say it? It was never far from her mind now, from her mouth. The words she knew were useless, if any words could be described as that. Certainly she knew they could not make the thing happen. If they could she would surround him with them, encase him with her words.<br>&#x201c;Come home when you can,&#x201d; she said instead, her voice light.<br>He kissed her. &#x201c;I will. In a few days, a week at the most. Call me when you get there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;D&#x2019;accord.&#x201d; She got into the car.<br>&#x201c;Je t&#x2019;aime,&#x201d; he said, putting his gloved hand into the window to touch her shoulder.<br>Watch out, her mind screamed. Be safe. Come home with me. Be careful, be careful, be careful.<br>She put her own gloved hand over his. &#x201c;Je t&#x2019;aime.&#x201d;<br>And then she was gone, back to Montreal, glancing in the rear-view mirror to see him standing on the deserted early morning street, Henri naturally at his side. Both watching her, until she disappeared.<br>The Chief Inspector continued to stare even after she&#x2019;d turned the corner. Then he picked up a shovel and slowly cleared the night&#x2019;s fluffy snowfall from the front steps. Resting for a moment, his arms crossed over the handle of the shovel, he marveled at the beauty as the first light hit the new snow. It looked more pale blue than white, and here and there it sparkled like tiny prisms where the flakes had drifted and collected, then caught, remade, and returned the light. Like something alive and giddy.<br>Life in the old walled city was like that. Both gentle and dynamic, ancient and vibrant.<br>Picking up a handful of snow, the Chief Inspector mashed it into a ball in his fist. Henri immediately stood, his tail going so hard his entire rear swayed. His eyes burning into the ball.<br>Gamache tossed it into the air and the dog leapt, his mouth closing over the snowball, and chomping down. Landing on all fours Henri was once again surprised that the thing that had been so solid had suddenly disappeared.<br>Gone, so quickly.<br>But next time would be different.<br>Gamache chuckled. He might be right.<br>Just then �mile stepped out from his doorway, bundled in an immense winter coat against the biting February cold.<br>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; The elderly man clamped a toque onto his head, pulling it down so that it covered his ears and forehead, and put on thick mitts, like boxing gloves.<br>&#x201c;For what? A siege?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For breakfast, mon vieux. Come along, before someone gets the last croissant.&#x201d;<br>He knew how to motivate his former subordinate. Hardly pausing for Gamache to replace the shovel, �mile headed off up the snowy street. Around them the other residents of Quebec City were waking up. Coming out into the tender morning light to shovel, to scrape the snow from their cars, to walk to the boulangerie for their morning baguette and caf�.<br>The two men and Henri set out along rue St-Jean, past the restaurants and tourist shops, to a tiny side street called rue Couillard, and there they found Chez Temporel.<br>They&#x2019;d been coming to this caf� for fifteen years, ever since Superintendent �mile Comeau had retired to old Quebec City, and Gamache had come to visit, to spend time with his mentor, and to help with the little chores that piled up. Shoveling, stacking wood for the fire-place, sealing windows against drafts. But this visit was different. Like no other in all the winters Chief Inspector Gamache had been coming to Quebec City.<br>This time it was Gamache who needed help.<br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; �mile leaned back, cupping his bowl of caf� au lait in slender hands. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the research going?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t yet find any references to Captain Cook actually meeting Bougainville before the Battle of Qu�bec, but it was 250 years ago. Records are scattered and weren&#x2019;t well kept. But I know they&#x2019;re in there,&#x201d; said Gamache. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an amazing library, �mile. The volumes go back centuries.&#x201d;<br>Comeau watched his companion talk about sifting through arcane books in a local library and the tidbits he was unearthing about a battle long ago fought, and lost. At least, from his point of view lost. Was there a spark in those beloved eyes at last? Those eyes he&#x2019;d stared into so often at the scenes of dreadful crimes as they&#x2019;d hunted murderers. As they&#x2019;d raced through woods and villages and fields, through clues and evidence and suspicions. Adown Titanic glooms of chasmed fears, �mile remembered the quote as he remembered those days. Yes, he thought, that described it. Chasmed fears. Both their own, and the murderers. Across tables across the province he and Gamache had sat. Just like this.<br>But now it was time to rest from murder. No more killing, no more deaths. Armand had seen too much of that lately. No, better to bury himself in history, in lives long past. An intellectual pursuit, nothing more.<br>Beside them Henri stirred and Gamache instinctively lowered his hand to stroke the shepherd&#x2019;s head and reassure him.

At its heart is the discovery of the order that lies deep within the most complex of systems, from the origin of life, to the workings of giant corporations, to the rise and fall of great civilizations. And more than anyone else, this revolution is the work of one man, Stuart Kauffman, a MacArthur Fellow and visionary pioneer of the new science of complexity. Now, in <em>At Home in the Universe</em>, Kauffman brilliantly weaves together the excitement of intellectual discovery and a fertile mix of insights to give the general reader a fascinating look at this new science--and at the forces for order that lie at the edge of chaos.<br> We all know of instances of spontaneous order in nature--an oil droplet in water forms a sphere, snowflakes have a six-fold symmetry. What we are only now discovering, Kauffman says, is that the range of spontaneous order is enormously greater than we had supposed. Indeed, self-organization is a great undiscovered principle of nature. But how does this spontaneous order arise? Kauffman contends that complexity itself triggers self-organization, or what he calls "order for free," that if enough different molecules pass a certain threshold of complexity, they begin to self-organize into a new entity--a living cell. Kauffman uses the analogy of a thousand buttons on a rug--join two buttons randomly with thread, then another two, and so on. At first, you have isolated pairs; later, small clusters; but suddenly at around the 500th repetition, a remarkable transformation occurs--much like the phase transition when water abruptly turns to ice--and the buttons link up in one giant network. Likewise, life may have originated when the mix of different molecules in the primordial soup passed a certain level of complexity and self-organized into living entities (if so, then life is not a highly improbable chance event, but almost inevitable). Kauffman uses the basic insight of "order for free" to illuminate a staggering range of phenomena. We see how a single-celled embryo can grow to a highly complex organism with over two hundred different cell types. We learn how the science of complexity extends Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection: that self-organization, selection, and chance are the engines of the biosphere. And we gain insights into biotechnology, the stunning magic of the new frontier of genetic engineering--generating trillions of novel molecules to find new drugs, vaccines, enzymes, biosensors, and more. Indeed, Kauffman shows that ecosystems, economic systems, and even cultural systems may all evolve according to similar general laws, that tissues and terra cotta evolve in similar ways. And finally, there is a profoundly spiritual element to Kauffman's thought. If, as he argues, life were bound to arise, not as an incalculably improbable accident, but as an expected fulfillment of the natural order, then we truly are at home in the universe.<br> Kauffman's earlier volume, <em>The Origins of Order</em>, written for specialists, received lavish praise. Stephen Jay Gould called it "a landmark and a classic." And Nobel Laureate Philip Anderson wrote that "there are few people in this world who ever ask the right questions of science, and they are the ones who affect its future most profoundly. Stuart Kauffman is one of these." In <em>At Home in the Universe</em>, this visionary thinker takes you along as he explores new insights into the nature of life.<br></p><p>The best treatment I have yet encountered about how order emerges naturally -- and possibly even necessarily -- out of chaos. Profoundly important, and considerably more informed than better-known pop-science treatments of chaos theory. Very highly recommended.<br><strong>Stuart Kauffman</strong> is a member of the Santa Fe Institute. A MacArthur Fellowship recipient, he is the leading thinker on self-organization and the science of complexity as applied to biology.<br></p><h2>Advanced Calculus (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>"This book is a radical departure from all previous concepts of advanced calculus," declared the <i>Bulletin of the American Mathematics Society, </i>"and the nature of this departure merits serious study of the book by everyone interested in undergraduate education in mathematics." Classroom-tested in a Princeton University honors course, it offers students a unified introduction to advanced calculus. <br>Starting with an abstract treatment of vector spaces and linear transforms, the authors introduce a single basic derivative in an invariant form. All other derivatives &#x2014; gradient, divergent, curl, and exterior &#x2014; are obtained from it by specialization. The corresponding theory of integration is likewise unified, and the various multiple integral theorems of advanced calculus appear as special cases of a general Stokes formula. The text concludes by applying these concepts to analytic functions of complex variables.</p><p></p><h2>Public Policy: Perspectives and Choices</h2><p>Drones. "Obamacare." Immigration. The economy.

Malone are professors of political science at the US Naval Academy.A serious-minded assessment that does not shy from hot political issues ... highly recommended.

(Frank C. Thames, Texas Tech University)</p><h2>The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene</h2><p>Renowned philosopher Mary Midgley explores the nature of our moral constitution to challenge the view that reduces human motivation to self-interest. Midgley argues cogently and convincingly that simple, one-sided accounts of human motives, such as the &#39;selfish gene&#39; tendency in recent neo-Darwinian thought, may be illuminating but are always unrealistic. Such neatness, she shows, cannot be imposed on human psychology. She returns to Darwin&#39;s original writings to show how the reductive individualism which is now presented as Darwinism does not derive from Darwin but from a wider, Hobbesian tradition in Enlightenment thinking. She reveals the selfish gene hypothesis as a cultural accretion that is just not seen in nature. Heroic independence is not a realistic aim for Homo sapiens. We are, as Darwin saw, earthly organisms, framed to interact constantly with one another and with the complex ecosystems of which we are a tiny part. For us, bonds are not just restraints but also lifelines.</p><p>Mary Midgley is one of the most respected moral philosophers of her generation and the author of many books, including Beast and Man, Wickedness and The Myths We Live by. Her memoir, The Owl of Minerva, was published by Routledge in 2005. She celebrated her 90th birthday in 2009."In this humane, readable and erudite book, Midgley shows empathy with human conflicts about motives. In the context of higher education, this is precisely the book that could engage students from the humanities and colleagues from the natural sciences in a genuine conversation on human nature." Willem B. Drees, Leiden University, Times Higher Education<br><br>"In many ways, the book is itself a summary. It leaves us with a very short work that highlights the connections between biological, socio-political, and philosophical developments covering several hundred years of history. It emphasizes the importance of a proper understanding of that historical context for contemporary debates, and attempts to both criticize and develop a defensible alternative. It does all of this and still finds space for a number of insightful and provocative asides. In brief, it is a short walk of uncommon breadth, one that challenges even while many of the particular arguments have a familiar ring." Philosophy Review<br><br>"Althought a short book, The Solitary Self is packed with ideas - ranging over political philosophy, philosophical psychology, philosophy of science, and the legacy of Darwin. A central theme of the book is a criticism of the reductionist views in philosophy of science, which Midgley sees as motivating wrongheaded oversimplification. Midgley counters such views, in part, by appealing to what she sees as the richer understanding of animal consciousness found in Darwin. The book is written in an engaging style accessible to readers at all levels. Highly recommended."

The deeper meaning of quantum mechanics remains controversial almost a century after its invention. Providing a way past quantum theory&#x2019;s paradoxes and puzzles, <i>QBism </i>offers a strikingly new interpretation that opens up for the nonspecialist reader the profound implications of quantum mechanics for how we understand and interact with the world.</p><p>Short for Quantum Bayesianism, QBism adapts many of the conventional features of quantum mechanics in light of a revised understanding of probability. Bayesian probability, unlike the standard &#x201c;frequentist probability,&#x201d; is defined as a numerical measure of the degree of an observer&#x2019;s belief that a future event will occur or that a particular proposition is true. Bayesianism&#x2019;s advantages over frequentist probability are that it is applicable to singular events, its probability estimates can be updated based on acquisition of new information, and it can effortlessly include frequentist results. But perhaps most important, much of the weirdness associated with quantum theory&#x2015;the idea that an atom can be in two places at once, or that signals can travel faster than the speed of light, or that Schr�dinger&#x2019;s cat can be simultaneously dead and alive&#x2015;dissolves under the lens of QBism.</p><p>Using straightforward language without equations, Hans Christian von Baeyer clarifies the meaning of quantum mechanics in a commonsense way that suggests a new approach to physics in general.</p></p><p><p>Hans Christian von Baeyer is Chancellor Professor of Physics, Emeritus, at the College of William and Mary.</p>&#x201c;Hans Christian von Baeyer has done a wonderful job with this book. I&#x2019;ve been fortunate enough to learn QBism twice in my life. The first time, it was the hard way, as colleagues and I battled out every nuance of the forming theory, always testing and retesting, tearing down and reconstructing&#x2015;we had to turn our world upside down to get there. But the second time was pure pleasure as I learned the subject afresh from Professor von Baeyer&#x2019;s masterful articulation of it. So many of his turns of phrase are insightful gems I never could have formulated myself. Now for the first time I believe I know how to teach the subject, and there is no better understanding one can have than that!&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher A. Fuchs, Professor of Physics, University of Massachusetts Boston, and key architect of QBism</b><br><br>&#x201c;Physicists all agree on how to do calculations using quantum mechanics and disagree markedly on what those calculations really mean. With his customary humor and elegance, Professor von Baeyer walks us through one of the more recent attempts to understand the mysterious world inside the atom.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Trefil, Professor of Physics, George Mason University, and the author of <i>Science in World History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;QBism remains controversial, but scientifically inclined readers will share von Baeyer&#x2019;s enthusiasm and come away with a feeling, if not a deep understanding, of quantum phenomena that doesn&#x2019;t require suspension of disbelief.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Von Baeyer offers a sensible approach to this seemingly esoteric world...He has an enthusiastic presentation and style that sweeps the reader along into the world of quantum physics and makes sense of it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ralph Peterson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Manhattan Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>QBism</i> should be applauded as a breeding ground of ideas for multiple disciplines including physics, philosophy, and mathematics, and von Baeyer&#x2019;s book offers an account accessible to all...[It] provide[s] an outstanding introduction to two of the key components of QBism (quantum theory and subjective Bayesianism), and places the reader into the mind of the QBist in a way that will aid the ongoing debate over its merit.

Divisive opinions abound. This informative, detailed text contains 39 writings on the history of reproduction in the U.S. The historical path of reproduction control is viewed in the contexts of politics, law, medicine, sexuality, business, and social change. Because birth control has been construed chiefly as a female responsibility, <i>Controlling Reproduction</i> stresses the centrality of gender in the history of reproduction and explores how and why reproduction-as a biological, social, and economic function-became a gender-assigned issue. <i>Controlling Reproduction</i> also includes some of the most significant debates currently guiding the study of reproduction.

Traditional liturgical scholarship has generally been marked by an attempt to fit together the various pieces of evidence for the practice of early Christian worship in such a way as to suggest that a single, coherent line of evolution can be traced from the apostolic age to the fourth century. Bradshaw examines this methodology in the light of recent developments in Jewish liturgical scholarship, of current trends in New Testament studies, and of the nature of the source-documents themselves, and especially the ancient church orders. In its place he offers a guide to Christian liturgical origins which adopts a much more cautious approach, recognizing the limitations of what can truly be known, and takes seriously the clues pointing to the essentially variegated character of ancient Christian worship.<br></p><p>Paul F. Bradshaw is at University of Notre Dame.<br><em>Praise for the first edition</em>: "An indispensable instrument for liturgical teaching and research."--<em>Worship</em><p></p><br>"Splendid--first rate!"--Edward Foley, Catholic Theological Union<p></p><br>"Thank you for this wonderfully informative book.

Seidman and his contributors also lay out the financial implications and trends of retention in one of their updated chapters. Completely new to this edition are three chapters that examine several recent issues: the current theories of retention, retention of online students, and retention in community colleges. Tying all of these components together, Seidman then presents his formula and highly successful model for student success that colleges can implement to effect change in retaining students and helping them to complete their academic and personal goals.</p><p>Alan Seidman is a faculty member and the General &amp; Self-Designed Specialization Coordinator with the Richard W. Riley College of Educational &amp; Leadership at Walden University, Minnesota. In addition, he is Executive Director of the Center for the Study of College Student Retention (www.cscsr.org).The ever-more challenging economics and politics of higher education have elevated the complex issues of college retention and persistence, making this second edition of Seidman&#x2019;s 2005 classic volume especially timely. The chapter authors are first-rate scholars, with most of the chapters thoroughly updated and with important additions, such as the special circumstances of community colleges and the effect of technology and on-line learning on retention and persistence. This is a must-read reference for students, scholars, and (one can only hope)policy-makers contending with the immensely difficult challenge of improving institutional retention and student persistence for the sake both of our economy and of those students we are currently losing. (D. Bruce Johnstone, professor of higher and comparative education emeritus, The University at Buffalo; former chancellor, SUNY system)<br><br>As a college president for forty-five years, I agonize over the issues of admission and retention since both impact so directly on finances and upon the ability of our higher education institutions to function effectively. This group of diverse specialists, under the lead editorship of Alan Seidman, has put together a master work on the subject of retention &#x2014; from defining and measuring it, to determining its past history and future promise. It goes beyond the theories, so well-worn, to projected actions in policies, programs, and practices that institutions can adopt and which help students &#x2014; and therefore colleges &#x2014; succeed. (Joseph N. Hankin, president, Westchester Community College)<br><br>For college and university administrators and faculty to successfully address their student retention challenges, they need to place their efforts in contexts beyond their specific institution. Seidman and colleagues, in a single text, provide a valuable historical, definitional, theoretical, empirical, financial, and practical context for framing retention strategy.

While the academic literature has spawned numerous case studies and context- or policy-specific models for collaboration, the growth of these innovative collaborative governance systems has outpaced the scholarship needed to define it. <br><br><i>Collaborative Governance Regimes</i> breaks new conceptual and practical ground by presenting an integrative framework for working across boundaries to solve shared problems, a typology for understanding variations among collaborative governance regimes, and an approach for assessing both process and productivity performance. This book draws on diverse literatures and uses rich case illustrations to inform scholars and practitioners about collaborative governance regimes and to provide guidance for designing, managing, and studying such endeavors in the future.<br><br><i>Collaborative Governance Regimes </i>will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in public administration, public policy, and political science who want a framework for theory building, yet the book is also accessible enough for students and practitioners.</p><p><b>Kirk Emerson</b> is a professor of practice in collaborative governance in the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona.

The study can be carried out in four ways: analytical, topological, algebraico-geometric, and arithmetic. This volume offers a rapid, concise, and self-contained introductory approach to the algebraic aspects of the third method, the algebraico-geometric. The treatment assumes only familiarity with elementary algebra up to the level of Galois theory.<br>Starting with an opening chapter on the general theory of places, the author advances to examinations of algebraic varieties, the absolute theory of varieties, and products, projections, and correspondences. Subsequent chapters explore normal varieties, divisors and linear systems, differential forms, the theory of simple points, and algebraic groups, concluding with a focus on the Riemann-Roch theorem. All the theorems of a general nature related to the foundations of the theory of algebraic groups are featured.</p><p>French-born Serge Lang (1927&#x2013;2005) graduated from Cal Tech and received his PhD from Princeton, where he studied under Emil Artin.

A selection of his published papers is presented here in two volumes, structured to indicate the direction and essential unity of the work. He starts from a polemical concern with behaviourism and other reductionist theories (particularly in psychology and the philosophy of language) which aim to model the study of man on the natural sciences. This leads to a general critique of naturalism, its historical development and its importance for modern culture and consciousness; and that in turn points, forward to a positive account of human agency and the self, the constitutive role of language and value, and the scope of practical reason. The volumes jointly present some two decades of work on these fundamental themes, and convey strongly the tenacity, verve and versatility of the author in grappling with them. They will interest a very wide range of philosophers and students of the human sciences.</p><p>Starting from a polemical concern with behaviorism and other reductionist theories, the volumes progress to a general critique of naturalism, its historical development and its importance for modern culture and consciousness.</p><h2>The Mathematics of Money Management: Risk Analysis Techniques for Traders</h2><p>Every futures, options, and stock markets trader operates under a set of highly suspect rules and assumptions. Are you risking your career on yours? Exceptionally clear and easy to use, The Mathematics of Money Management substitutes precise mathematical modeling for the subjective decision-making processes many traders and serious investors depend on. Step-by-step, it unveils powerful strategies for creating and using key money management formulas--based on the rules of probability and modern portfolio theory--that maximizes the potential gains for the level of risk you are assuming. With them, you&#39;ll determine the payoffs and consequences of any potential trading decision and obtain the highest potential growth for your specified level of risk. You&#39;ll quickly decide: What markets to trade in and at what quantities When to add or subtract funds from an account How to reinvest trading profits for maximum yield The Mathematics of Money Management provides the missing element in modern portfolio theory that weds optimal f to the optimal portfolio.</p><p>Permits traders in the futures, options and stock markets to create profitable trading formulas based on the rules of probability and modern portfolio theory. Shows how to develop and utilize key formulas which minimize losses, maximize profits and avoid excessive risk. Reintroduces the idea of ``optimal-f&#39;&#39; and its use in weighing and assigning values to the components of a trader&#39;s portfolio. Includes a computer program for immediate hands-on usage of techniques described.Until now, money management practices have been driven by a loose collection of highly subjective rules of thumb. By failing to accurately understand the outcomes of their potential actions, many traders and serious investors have been operating blind. The Mathematics of Money Management injects a new degree of precision into your trading strategies. Based on the rules of probability and modern portfolio theory, it shows you how to create and use these money management techniques in the futures, options, and stock markets. And you don&#x2019;t need to be a PhD to exploit these strategies. Every equation and formula is easy to understand, and practical examples are provided for immediate hands-on use of the trading techniques discussed. By wedding the precepts and practices of modern portfolio theory to the concept of optimal f, The Mathematics of Money Management shows how to gauge the payoffs and consequences of every potential trading action, before you take it. Armed with this information, you&#x2019;ll obtain the greatest potential investment growth for your specified level of risk, no matter what your chosen market. You&#x2019;ll use these time-tested strategies to: <ul> <li>Evaluate the risks and rewards of any potential trading decision</li> <li>Accurately weigh and assign values to the components of any portfolio</li> <li>Determine exactly how many contracts to trade for a specific market and/or system</li> <li>Maximize profits under reinvestment trading</li> <li>Prognosticate future system performance</li> </ul> Now you can bid good-bye to unreliable money management assumptions and faulty decision making. Here&#x2019;s the money management tool for making mathematically correct trading decisions.</p><h2>Journey of Adulthood -- Revel Access Code</h2><p><i>For courses in Adulthood and Aging and Psychology of Aging</i> <br> <br> <b>Reveal the dynamic process of development from early adulthood to end of life<br>Revel&#x2122; <i>The Journey of Adulthood</i> </b>explains the development of adults as they leave adolescence and move through their adult years until the end of life.

Our original research into the NLN Pre-Admission Examination (PAX) for Registered Nursing (RN) and Practical/Vocational Nursing (PN/VN or LPN/LVN), offered by the National League for Nursing (NLN), reveals the specific content areas and the essential skills that are critical for you to know on the PAX. We've taken the information and developed a study guide that is guaranteed to help you be successful on the PAX.</p><p>Now, we know you may be skeptical, so let us give you three good reasons we can back up what we claim:</p><p><b>The Three Reasons To Believe What We Say</b></p><p><b>The First Reason:</b></p><p>Our company's name is Mometrix Test Preparation, and we have a team of standardized test researchers who have worked on developing our study guide for the Nursing School Entrance Exam. The standards for who gets to work on the team are very strict- we demand the best for our customers, and only those who met our exacting standards made the cut. The dedicated research staff have years of combined experience in mastering the content and skills necessary to succeed on the toughest exams.</p><p><b>The Second Reason:</b></p><p>Some academic studies have revealed that test takers do not really benefit from the traditional test preparation process. But we knew there had to be a solution- if test takers were not doing well on the Nursing School Entrance Exam despite high intelligence, there had to be a set of secret keys to the test that would open the door of success for these test takers.</p><p>We believe we have succeeded in finding the secret keys of the exam. What we found was surprising, and in some cases <b>ridiculously simple</b> once explained to the average test taker.</p><p>We put the findings together in a thorough, concise study guide that we believe allows any test taker, at any skill level, to <b><b>improve his or her results dramatically</b></b> with a <i>minimum of effort</i>.</p><p><b>The Third Reason:</b></p><p>We created the product in part because we were frustrated by the options available to test takers who really wanted to do well on the Nursing School Entrance Exam.</p><p>A common approach is to TEACH the material, instead of TEACHING THE TEST. That's not necessarily good enough for the Nursing School Entrance Exam- you have to know how to apply the knowledge. Most test takers already have a general knowledge of the material that will be covered on the exam.</p><p>One reason some test takers do well on the day of the test is that they have made the critical connection between the material they learned and how to use the material to succeed on the Nursing School Entrance Exam.</p><p>Our guide addresses the difference between merely knowing the material and knowing how to use the material to <b>perform on test day</b>.</p><p>You're going to save time, money, and aggravation.

While Caesar, Cicero and Vergil have long vied for first place in the classical curriculum, Lucretius' treatment of universal human matters rightfully earns him a place in their company. <p> Catto's text of Lucretius provides 53 passages in 1294 lines, spanning all 6 books of the epic. Each section features a short introduction, discussion questions, vocabulary and extensive line-by-line notes on facing pages and a wide variety of illustrative quotations from both ancient and modern sources. </p><p>Also available:</p><p>Ovid: Selections from Ars Amatoria Remedia Amoris - ISBN 0865163952<br>The Phaedra of Seneca - ISBN 0865160163</p><p>For over 30 years Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers has produced the highest quality Latin and ancient Greek books. From Dr. Seuss books in Latin to Plato's <i>Apology</i>, Bolchazy-Carducci's titles help readers learn about ancient Rome and Greece; the Latin and ancient Greek languages are alive and well with titles like Cicero's <i>De Amicitia</i> and <i>Kaegi's Greek Grammar</i>. We also feature a line of contemporary eastern European and WWII books. </p><p> Some of the areas we publish in include: </p><p> Selections From The Aeneid<br> Latin Grammar &amp; Pronunciation<br> Greek Grammar &amp; Pronunciation<br> Texts Supporting Wheelock's Latin<br> Classical author workbooks: Vergil, Ovid, Horace, Catullus, Cicero<br> Vocabulary Cards For AP Selections: Vergil, Ovid, Catullus, Horace<br> Greek Mythology<br> Greek Lexicon<br> Slovak Culture And History</p></p><p>Text: English, Latin<br> Original Language: LatinBonnie Catto's <i>Lucretius: Selections from De Rerum Natura</i> is a welcome achievement for those of us who introduce this exciting text to high-school students... I have found other editions to be either too abridged, or too advanced in their expectations of the students' ability with Latin; all are too sketch in their presentation of modern scientific theory. Catto, however, provides enough notes so that fourth-year students can work out the passage on their own and also enough passages so that they get a good overall idea of the structure of Lucretius' poem. The variety of compared passages (from Empedocles to Stephen Hawking) renders most of my homemade handouts obsolete. Finally, Catto's questions...invite opinions on Lucretius' thoughts and methods of explanation and illustration. She has made an already relevant poem accessible to younger and intermediate students. --Elinor S. Wright<br><br>This is a good book. Those who wish to give second and third-year college students of Latin a good sampling of the <i>De rerum natura</i>, would do well to give this text their consideration. Following in the tradition of other learning texts offered by Bolchazy-Carducci, Catto's book offers the student not only a full sampling of the poem, but also an abundance of notes, vocabulary, and, perhaps most noteworthy of all, a florilegium of relevant passages selected from classical and non-classical authors that bear upon the particular Luretian passages to which they are attached. It is this combination of features which makes the book worthy of serious examination by anyone who intends to introduce students to Lucretius and his important poem. --C. A. Hoffman, Bryn Mawr Classical Review<br><br>Those who teach Lucretius to undergraduates as I have may find themselves wishing as I did for a volume of excerpts that provides the student with linguistic and intellectual aids for translating and comprehending this difficult but magnificent Roman poet without the spoon feeding that vitiates so many heavily annotated school texts. They need look no further than this book, a thoughtful edition of key selections from the poet prepared by Bonnie Catto.<p>Bonnie Catto's seventeen-page introduction is... a treasure trove for the teacher.</p><p>The passages are so chosen that the student has a comprehensive sampler of both Lucretian purple passages as well as the more technical passages of philosophical and scientific exegesis.</p><p>I wish that it had been available when I taught Lucretius, and I wish more ancient authors were so splendidly served. --Richard Moorton, Connecticut College, New England Classical Journal</p></p><h2>Magnetism: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Stephen J. Blundell illuminates the mysterious force of magnetism. For centuries, magnetism has been used for various purposes--through compasses it gave us the ability to navigate, and through motors, generators, and turbines, it has given us power. Blundell explores our understanding of electricity and magnetism, from the work of Galvani, Ampere, Faraday, and Tesla, and describes how Maxwell and Faraday's work led to the unification of electricity and magnetism--one of the most imaginative developments in theoretical physics. Finally, he discusses the relationship between magnetism and relativity, quantum magnetism, and its impact on computers and information storage, showing how magnetism has changed our fundamental understanding of the Universe.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen J. Blundell</strong> is Professor of Physics at Oxford University and a Fellow of Mansfield College.<br>This quite amazing book covers practically everything there is to know about magnetism. Ten seconds after opening the book, having scanned the contents section, I knew I was going to read not only about the birth of magnetism as a branch of scientific study, but also about Maxwells equations, relativity, quantum magnetism and technology. Two pages into the book, and I knew that the book was written in a relaxed, engaging, easy-to-follow style, which the author maintains throughout. * Paul van Kampen, Dublin City University, Contemporary Science *</p><h2>On Habit (Thinking in Action)</h2><p><p>For Aristotle, excellence is not an act but a habit, and Hume regards habit as &#x2018;the great guide of life&#x2019;. However, for Proust habit is problematic: &#x2018;if habit is a second nature, it prevents us from knowing our first.&#x2019;</p> <p>What is habit? Do habits turn us into machines or free us to do more creative things? Should religious faith be habitual? Does habit help or hinder the practice of philosophy? Why do Luther, Spinoza, Kant, Kierkegaard and Bergson all criticise habit? If habit is both a blessing and a curse, how can we live well in our habits?</p> <p>In this thought-provoking book Clare Carlisle examines habit from a philosophical standpoint. Beginning with a lucid appraisal of habit&#x2019;s philosophical history she suggests that both receptivity and resistance to change are basic principles of habit-formation. Carlisle shows how the philosophy of habit not only anticipates the discoveries of recent neuroscience but illuminates their ethical significance. She asks whether habit is a reliable form of knowledge by examining the contrasting interpretations of habitual thinking offered by Spinoza and Hume. She then turns to the role of habit in the good life, tracing Aristotle&#x2019;s legacy through the ideas of Joseph Butler, Hegel, and F�lix Ravaisson, and assessing the ambivalent attitudes to habit expressed by Nietzsche and Proust.</p> <p>She argues that a distinction between habit and practice helps to clarify this ambivalence, particularly in the context of habit and religion, where she examines both the theology of habit and the repetitions of religious life. She concludes by considering how philosophy itself is a practice of learning to live well with habit.</p></p><p><p><strong>Clare Carlisle</strong> is Lecturer in Philosophy of Religion at King&#x2019;s College London. She is the author of three books on Kierkegaard, including <i>Kierkegaard&#x2019;s Philosophy of Becoming: Movements and Positions</i> (2005), and <i>Kierkegaard&#x2019;s Fear and Trembling</i> (2010). In 2008 she published the first English translation of F�lix Ravaisson&#x2019;s seminal essay <i>De l&#x2019;habitude</i>. </p><p>"Clare Carlisle's <i>On Habit</i> is a rich and stimulating book on a topic that, despite having long been a key feature of western thinking, has drifted from the forefront of philosophical debate. This text serves as a timely reminder of the remarkably broad range of philosophical issues that reflection on habit covers. ... Carlisle does an impressive job of presenting a wide range of broad philosophical issues, including very difficult epistemological and ontological problems, in a way that will be stimulating for both specialists and non-specialists alike."<i> - Jeremy William Dunham, British Journal for the History of Philosophy</i></p> <p>A <i>CHOICE</i> Outstanding Academic Title, 2014</p> <p>"Carlisle offers a smart, well-written introduction to habit and the role it plays in people's lives. She provides a broad, far-reaching analysis of the role that habit has played in major philosophical works, ranging from ancient Greece to the present; this analysis is both rigorous and accessible to nonacademic readers. ... Carlisle's treatment of the relationship of habit to the topics of freedom of the will and morality is impressive. ... She is careful to address concerns about the prima facie incompatibility of free will and habit throughout the book but never gets bogged down in the complicated, highly divisive nature of the free will problem. Summing Up: Highly recommended." - <i>William Simkulet, CHOICE</i></p> <p>"Remarkably rich in reference, erudite but never ponderous, this finely crafted study brings out the philosophical importance of a hitherto often neglected topic. Elegantly and accessibly written, it has much to offer specialists and general readers alike."<i> - John Cottingham, Heythrop College London and University of Reading, UK</i></p><i> </i><p><i></i>"Immensely readable, and offering a myriad of helpful analogies and applications, <i>On Habit</i> is a guide to reflection on some of the defining puzzles of being human, bringing us face to face with fundamental issues relating to identity, morality, and religion. This is not the kind of popular philosophy that does our thinking for us and provides us with ready-made answers, but an invitation to serious thinking about who we really are."<i> - George Pattison, University of Glasgow, UK</i></p></p><h2>Introducing Ethics: A Critical Thinking Approach with Readings</h2><p><em>Introducing Ethics: A Critical Thinking Approach with Readings</em> combines guiding commentary and questions with a rich selection of concise, carefully edited, and accessible readings on ethical theory and contemporary moral issues.

He argues that Paul's letters are concerned not with the foundation of a new religion but rather with the "messianic" abolition of Jewish law. Situating Paul's texts in the context of early Jewish messianism, this book is part of a growing set of recent critiques devoted to the period when Judaism and Christianity were not yet fully distinct, placing Paul in the context of what has been called "Judaeo-Christianity." Agamben's philosophical exploration of the problem of messianism leads to the other major figure discussed in this book, Walter Benjamin. Advancing a claim without precedent in the vast literature on Benjamin, Agamben argues that Benjamin's philosophy of history constitutes a repetition and appropriation of Paul's concept of "remaining time." Through a close reading and comparison of Benjamin's "Theses on the Philosophy of History" and the Pauline Epistles, Agamben discerns a number of striking and unrecognized parallels between the two works.</p><p>Giorgio Agamben is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Venice. Stanford University Press has published five of his previous books: <i>Homo Sacer</i> (1998), <i>Potentialities: Collected Essays in Philosophy </i> (1999), <i>The Man Without Content</i> (1999), <i>The End of the Poem</i> (1999), and <i>The Open</i> (2004)."Agamben, through the close reading of Pauline letter and the comparison of W. Benjamin's philosophy of history, gives us a fruitful key to better understand Western history and civilization. Philosophers and theologians will learn a great deal from reading this book." (<i>Philosophy in Review/Comptes Rendus philosophiques</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Time that Remains</i> presents itself as an exegetical seminar on the opening line of the Letter to the Romans ("Paul, called as a slave of Jesus the Messiah, separated as apostle for the announcement of God")... Agamben's insightful close reading of the Pauline corpus sets this book apart from the more free-range grazing over the text modeled by Badiou and iek."

The study of the law regarding animals combines a review of the statutory and decisional law in which the nature legal, social and/or biological of non-human animals is an important factor. Owing to the rapid growth in this field, the sixth edition has updates in almost every chapter, with new focus on cases involving animals in agriculture and the complex legal challenges to laws aimed at providing them with greater protections. In connection with that expansion, a new section addresses the growing advent of ag-gag laws and legal issues surrounding them. And the interplay of constitutional law and animal issues is further highlighted with discussion of recent cases and statutory developments. This casebook continues to provide a detailed survey format that touches on many areas in which animals affect legal doctrines, case law, and legislative direction. Because animal law is not a traditional legal field, the book is largely framed according to traditional legal headings such as tort, contract, criminal, and constitutional law. Each chapter sets out cases and commentary in areas where animal law continues to develop its own doctrine.</p><p>Bruce Wagman is Of Counsel at Riley Safer Holmes &amp; Cancila, and is an Adjunct Professor of Law at UC Hastings College of the Law, Stanford Law School, and Berkeley Law.

Wade</em>, reports surfaced that twelve-year-old Minnie Lee Relf and her fourteen-year-old sister Mary Alice, the daughters of black Alabama farm hands, had been sterilized without their or their parents' knowledge or consent. Just as women's ability to control reproduction moved to the forefront of the feminist movement, the Relf sisters' plight stood as a reminder of the ways in which the movement's accomplishments had diverged sharply along racial lines. Thousands of forced sterilizations were performed on black women during this period, convincing activists in the Black Power, civil rights, and women's movements that they needed to address, pointedly, the racial injustices surrounding equal access to reproductive labor and intimate life in America. As horrific as the Relf tragedy was, it fit easily within a set of critical events within black women's sexual and reproductive history in America, which black feminists argue began with coerced reproduction and enforced child neglect in the period of enslavement. <br><br>While reproductive rights activists and organizations, historians, and legal scholars have all begun to grapple with this history and its meaning, political theorists have yet to do so. <em>Intimate Justice </em>charts the long and still incomplete path to black female intimate freedom and equality--a path marked by infanticides, sexual terrorism, race riots, coerced sterilizations, and racially biased child removal policies. In order to challenge prevailing understandings of freedom and equality, Shatema Threadcraft considers the troubled status of black female intimate life during four moments: antebellum slavery, Reconstruction, the nadir, and the civil rights and women's movement eras. Taking up important and often overlooked aspects of the necessary conditions for justice, Threadcraft's book is a compelling challenge to the meaning of equality in American race and gender relations.<br></p><p><br><strong>Shatema Threadcraft </strong>is Associate Professor in the Department of Government at Dartmouth College. Her research has been supported by the Ford Foundation, the American Association of University Women, the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University, the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, the Rutgers Center for Historical Analysis, and the Rutgers Center for Race and Ethnicity.<br><br>"With theoretical sophistication and admirable moral clarity, <em>Intimate Justice</em> reframes what corrective racial justice should entail by taking the deprivation of black women's intimate capacities as its starting point. Threadcraft makes a compelling case that the debate about racial justice has focused almost exclusively on the civic harms suffered by blacks in the public sphere, thereby overlooking the thwarting of black women's intimate capacities in the private sphere. She brilliantly spells out what a fuller account of racial justice would entail." <br> --Juliet Hooker, Associate Professor of Government and African Diaspora Studies, University of Texas at Austin <br><p></p><br>"'Establishing meaningful intimate justice is every bit as important as economic and political justice.' Shatema Threadcraft's <em>Intimate Justice</em> powerfully demonstrates the wisdom of that claim and the urgency of developing a theory of freedom that locates the historical and contemporary experiences of African American women and girls at its center. This is a foundational text for all political theorists." <br>--Lawrie Balfour, author of <em>Democracy's Reconstruction: Thinking Politically with W.E.B. Du Bois</em> <br><p></p><br>"Threadcraft's <em>Intimate Justice</em> is remarkably confident, sophisticated, and engrossing. This fresh, ambitious work successfully brings feminist political theory together with Black feminist thought, richly exploring ways to think about and achieve justice within the sphere of intimate relations." <br>--Rickie Solinger, author of <em>Reproductive Justice: What Everyone Needs to Know</em> <br><p></p><br>"As a result of the legacy of the violation of Black women, Threadcraft suggests the creation of local, Black-female led offices that act as service centers for victims and also provide cultural and representational support for Black women. Such spaces could help change the meaning of Black womanhood by uplifting the art and creative contributions of Black women, allowing them to define themselves." - Melissa Brown, <em> University of Maryland</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System, The</h2><p><p>The most complete, authoritative technical guide to the FreeBSD kernel&#x2019;s internal structure has now been extensively updated to cover all major improvements between Versions 5 and 11.

The war embroiled the entire Greek world, provoking years of butchery previously unparalleled in ancient Greece. Whole cities were exterminated, their men killed, their women and children enslaved. While the war is commonly believed to have ended with the capture of the Athenian navy in 405 and the subsequent starvation of Athens, fighting in Greece would continue for several decades. Sparta's authority was challenged in the so-called Corinthian War (395-387) when Persian gold helped unite Athens with Sparta's former allies. The war did not truly end until, in 371, Thebes' crack infantry resoundingly defeated Sparta at Leuctra, forever shattering the myth of Spartan military supremacy.<br><br>Jennifer Roberts' rich narrative of this famous conflict is the first general history to tell the whole story, from the war's origins down to Sparta's defeat at Leuctra. In her masterful account, this long and bloody war affected every area of life in Athens, exacerbated divisions between rich and poor in Sparta, and sparked civil strife throughout the Greek world. Yet despite the biting sorrows the fighting occasioned, it remains a gripping saga of plots and counter-plots, murders and lies, thrilling sea chases and desperate overland marches, missed opportunities and last-minute reprieves, and, as the war's first historian Thucydides had hoped, lessons for a less bellicose future. In addition, Roberts considers the impact of the war on Greece's cultural life, including the great masterworks of tragedy and comedy performed at this time and, most infamously, the trial and execution of Socrates. A fast-paced narrative of one of antiquity's most famous clashes, <em>The Plague of War </em>is a must-read for history enthusiasts of all ages.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jennifer T.

The Forest Ranger has been essential reading for generations of professionals and scholars in forestry, public administration, and organizational behavior who are interested in the administration of public lands and how the top managers of a large, dispersed organization with multiple objectives like the Forest Service shape the behavior of its field officers into a coherent, unified program. Published as a special reprint in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Forest Service, The Forest Ranger is as relevant and timely today as when it was first issued in 1960. In addition to the original text, this special reprint of The Forest Ranger includes two new forewords and an afterword that highlight how much we have learned from Herbert Kaufman. The first foreword, by Harold K. (Pete) Steen, former president of the Forest History Society, considers the book&#39;s impact on the forestry community and explains its continued relevance in light of changes in the culture and mission of today&#39;s Forest Service. The second, by Richard P. Nathan, co-director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government, considers the book&#39;s contribution to our understanding of administrative and organizational behavior. A new afterword by author Herbert Kaufman describes how his landmark study came into being and offers a candid assessment of how his theories about the agency&#39;s operations and its future have held up over time. In 1960, the Forest Service had a welldeserved reputation for excellence, and The Forest Ranger was a seminal analysis of the how&#39;s and why&#39;s of its success. Kaufman also warned, however, that an organization so unified and well adapted to its environment would have difficulties navigating social change. He was right in his concerns: The environmental, civil rights, and women&#39;s movements have all presented challenges to the character and purpose of the Forest Service, ultimately changing the organization in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Now, as then, The Forest Ranger is a striking and prescient case study of how a complex organization operates and evolves over time.</p><p>Herbert Kaufman, now retired, was a professor of political science at Yale University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. His other books include The Administrative Behavior of Federal Bureau Chiefs; Red Tape: Its Origins, Uses, and Abuses; Are Government Organizations Immortal?; and The Limits of Organizational Change.'The best single account of forestry management remains Herbert Kaufman&#x2018;s The Forest Ranger: A Study in Administrative Behavior.'

In Part 1, she combines knowledge gained from her firsthand experiences living among and speaking with Indian elders with a careful analysis of historical accounts, providing a succinct yet insightful look at people, events, and institutions from the 1800s to the present. She clarifies unique and complex relationships among Indian peoples and dispels many of the false pretenses promoted by United States agencies over two centuries. In Part 2, Kehoe surveys some of the theories used to analyze the events described in Part 1, allowing readers to see how theories develop, to think critically about various perspectives, and to draw their own conclusions.

While ostensibly focusing on the life of Jack Wilson (Wovoka) and the Ghost Dance, Kehoe examines other prophets and other cultural developments in both earlier and later times. All of this she contextualizes in the economic, political, and social milieu of the day. Included here is a concise history of the complex relations between Native American tribes and American and European societies from the sixteenth century up through to the present day. The personal details of her research, as both preface and epilogue, also reveals the changing nature of anthropology itself and of anthropologist&#x2019;s relationships with members of other cultural groups. Kehoe&#x2019;s engaging critical anthropological and historical analysis of the Ghost Dance and other revitalization movements should be required reading of all students of anthropology, Native Studies, religion, and related areas of study.

The chapters are organized in five sections: Legal Traditions and Institutions, Crimes and Punishments, Harry Potter and Identity, the Wizard Economy, and Harry Potter as an Archetype. Some chapters analyze the way law and legal institutions are portrayed, and what these portrayals teach us about concepts such as morality, justice, and difference. Other chapters use examples from the narratives to illustrate or analyze legal issues, such as human rights, actual innocence, and legal pedagogy. The volume is suitable for undergraduate or law school courses, and will be of interest to those Harry Potter fans who also have an interest in law and the legal profession.</p><p>Jeffrey Thomas is a professor at University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.

Moving portraits from the lives of six friends bring to life the structural characteristics and qualities of meaning-making practices, particularly practices that reveal the political tensions of defining who gets to be literate and who does not. Key chapters on language, literacy, race, and masculinity examine how the literacies, languages, and identities of these friends are shaped by the silences of societal denial. Ultimately, <em>A Search Past Silence</em> is a passionate call for educators to listen to the silenced voices of Black youth and to re-imagine the concept of being literate in a multicultural democratic society.</p></p><p><p><br> &#x201c;This beauty of a book deserves to be read and reread.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<br> <strong>Sonia Nieto</strong><br> , University of Massachusetts, Amherst<br> </p><br><br><p><br> &#x201c;These remarkable insights make it possible for us to reject the caricatures of Black males so that we can see them as they are.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;From the Foreword by<br> <strong>Pedro Noguera</strong><br> , New York University<br> </p><br><br><p><br> &#x201c;For those who don&#x2019;t know that young Black males from the hood read&#x2014;and even write, believe it or not!&#x2014;<br> <em>A Search Past Silence</em><br> will be a haunting wake-up call.

Each book investigates an element of the craft of fiction, creative nonfiction, or poetry by discussing works by authors past and present. The books in the Art Of series are not strictly manuals, but serve readers and writers by illuminating aspects of the craft of writing that people <i>think </i>they already know but don't <i>really </i>know.</p><p>Donald Revell argues passionately for the transformation that imaginative experience elicits through poetry. "The art of poetry is not about the acquisition of wiles or the deployment of strategies," Revell writes. "Beginning in the senses, imagination senses farther, senses more." Using examples from his own poetry <br>and translations and from Blake and Thoreau to Ronald Johnson and John Ashbery, Revell's <i>The Art of Attention: A Poet's Eye </i>takes the writer beyond the workshop and into the world of vision.</p></p><p><b>DONALD REVELL</b> is the author of ten poetry collections, including <i>Pennyweight Windows: New &amp; Selected Poems </i>and <i>My Mojave</i>, which won the Lenore Marshall Prize. He teaches at the University of Utah, and lives in the desert south of Las Vegas.This short and wonderful second book of prose from poet Revell (<i>A Thief of Strings</i>) begins as an essay on luminous mystical vision and ends as a poetic autobiography, explaining how the poet got from the bitter, involuted verse of his first books to his pellucid, delighted and delightful recent work. In between, Revell argues that poets should translate, with examples from Ezra Pound and Revell's own engagement with Guillaume Apollinaire; he also argues that familiar ideas about imagination, originality, craft and revision have the true poetic process exactly backwards. True poetry, for Revell as for his frequent model Thoreau, flows from openness to whatever awaits us outside the self. That openness is for Revell finally religious (in his case, Christian): it is simply natural, he maintains, that plain attention is a piety and that the unaggressive articulation of attention in poems may be a form of prayer, an instance of worship. This compact book (part of Graywolf's new Art Of series on the craft of writing) seems designed in part for poetry workshops, but Revell's unusual take makes this as much a warmhearted essay on metaphysics as a guidebook, which is likely to make any poetry lover stop and pay attention. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sharing openly from his own life, his experiences working as a psychiatrist and seminar leader and his many years as a disciple of an enlightened spiritual master, Krishnananda (Thomas O. Trobe M.D.) takes us on a journey of self-discovery, self-love and healing. The approach and the message is simple. Through acceptance, understanding and compassion, we can uncover and heal the deepest wounds of our soul. This book is designed for anyone who longs to heal and to experience love. Do we ever ask ourselves what causes us so much anxiety? Why do we suffer when we don&#39;t get the love we want and need? What is the source of our fear and insecurities and how can we heal them? These are the questions that the author addresses in this book. Hiding behind our protections, denial and addictive behaviors, is a profoundly panicked and wounded part of us. Until we make friends with this frightened child inside, our life can never be a joyful and loving experience and we live in a state of co-dependency either in conflict, disappointment or in isolation. But when we open to our wounded vulnerability and heal it, we bring love and fulfillment into our lives. This book describes this healing journey. It is easy to read and full of personal examples which helps us to realize that we are all in the same boat - a boat of healing our wounds so that we can enjoy life as we are meant to enjoy it.</p><p></p><h2>The Man Who Talks with the Flowers-The Intimate Life Story of Dr. George Washington Carver</h2><p>2012 reprint of 1939 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. George Washington Carver (1864-1943) was an American scientist, botanist, educator and inventor. Much of Carver&#39;s fame is based on his research into and promotion of alternative crops to cotton, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes. He wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops both as a source of their own food and as a source of other products to improve their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes that used peanuts. He also promoted about 100 products made from peanuts that were useful for the house and farm, including cosmetics, dyes, paints, plastics, gasoline, and nitroglycerin. In addition to his work on agricultural extension education for purposes of advocacy of sustainable agriculture and appreciation of plants and nature, Carver&#39;s important accomplishments also included improvement of racial relations, mentoring children, poetry, painting, and religion. He served as an example of the importance of hard work, a positive attitude, and a good education. His humility, humanitarianism, good nature, frugality, and rejection of economic materialism also have been admired widely. This is the story of Glenn Clark&#39;s friendship with Carver.</p><p></p><h2>The Fifth Gospel: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John...You</h2><p><p>&#x201c;There are five Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John...and the Christian.

Two South American teenagers are playing Gameboys on a sofa near reception, kicking back in hundred-dollar trainers while Daddy picks up the bill. The older of them swears loudly in Spanish and then catches his brother square on the knot of his shoulder with a dead arm that makes him wince in pain. A passing waiter looks down, shrugs, and empties an ashtray at their table. There&#x2019;s a general atmosphere of listless indifference, of time passing by to no end, the prerush lull of late afternoons.<br>&#x201c;Buenas tardes, se�or.&#x201d;<br>The receptionist is wide shouldered and artificially blond and I play the part of a tourist, making no effort to speak to her in Spanish.<br>&#x201c;Good afternoon. I have a reservation here today.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The name, sir?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Alec Milius.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br>She ducks down and taps something into a computer. Then there&#x2019;s a smile, a little nod of recognition, and she writes down my details on a small piece of card.<br>&#x201c;The reservation was made over the Internet?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Could I see your passport please, sir?&#x201d;<br>Five years ago, almost to the day, I spent my first night in Madrid at this same hotel; a twenty-eight-year-old industrial spy on the run from the UK with $189,000 lodged in five separate bank accounts, using three passports and a forged British driving licence for ID. On that occasion I handed a Lithuanian passport issued to me in Paris in August 1997 to the clerk behind the desk. The hotel may have a record of this on their system, so I&#x2019;m using it again.<br>&#x201c;You are from Vilnius?&#x201d; the receptionist asks.<br>&#x201c;My grandfather was born there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, breakfast is between seven thirty and eleven o&#x2019;clock and you have it included as part of your rate.&#x201d; It is as if she has no recollection of having asked the question. &#x201c;Is it just yourself staying with us?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just myself.&#x201d;<br>My luggage consists of a suitcase filled with old newspapers and a leather briefcase containing some toiletries, a laptop computer, and two of my three mobile phones. We&#x2019;re not planning to stay in the room for more than a few hours. A porter is summoned from across the lobby and he escorts me to the lifts at the back of the hotel. He&#x2019;s short and tanned and genial in the manner of low-salaried employees badly in need of a tip. His English is rudimentary, and it&#x2019;s tempting to break into Spanish just to make the conversation more lively.<br>&#x201c;This is being your first time in Madrid, yes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Second, actually. I visited two years ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For the bullfights?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On business.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like the corrida?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that. I just didn&#x2019;t have the time.&#x201d;<br>The room is situated halfway down a long, Barton Fink corridor on the third floor. The porter uses a credit-card-sized pass key to open the door and places my suitcase on the ground. The lights are operated by inserting the key in a narrow horizontal slot outside the bathroom door, although I know from experience that a credit card works just as well; anything narrow enough to trigger the switch will do the trick. The room is a reasonable size, perfect for our needs, but as soon as I am inside I frown and make a show of looking disappointed and the porter duly asks if everything is all right.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I asked for a room with a view over the square. Could you see at the desk if it would be possible to change?&#x201d;<br>Back in 1998, as an overt target conscious of being watched by both American and British intelligence, I ran basic countersurveillance measures as soon as I arrived at the hotel, searching for microphones and hidden cameras. Five years later, I am either wiser or lazier; the simple last-minute switch of room negates any need to sweep. The porter has no choice but to return to reception and within ten minutes I have been assigned a new room on the fourth floor with a clear view over Plaza de Santa Ana. After a quick shower I put on a dressing gown, turn down the air-conditioning, and try to make the room look less functional by folding up the bedspread, placing it in a cupboard, and opening the net curtains so that the decent February light can flood in. It&#x2019;s cold outside, but I stand briefly on the balcony looking out over the square. A neat line of denuded chestnut trees runs east toward the Teatro de Espa�a where a young African man is selling counterfeit CDs from a white sheet spread out on the pavement. In the distance I can see the edge of the Parque Retiro and the roofs of the taller buildings on Calle de Alcal�. It&#x2019;s a typical midwinter afternoon in Madrid: high blue skies, a brisk wind whipping across the square, sunlight on my face. Turning back into the room I pick up one of the mobiles and dial her number from memory.<br>&#x201c;Sof�a?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hola, Alec.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What is the number of the room?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Cuatrocientos ocho. Just walk straight through the lobby. There&#x2019;s nobody there and they won&#x2019;t stop you or ask any questions. Keep to the left. The elevators are at the back. Fourth floor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is everything OK?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s OK.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Vale,&#x201d; she says. Fine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there in an hour.&#x201d;<br>Excerpted from The Spanish Game by .<br>Copyright © 2006 by Charles Cumming.<br>Published in December 2008 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press.<br>All rights reserved.

Launius explores the many-faceted stories told about the meaning of the Apollo program and how it forever altered American society. The Apollo missions marked the first time human beings left Earth's orbit and visited another world, and thus they loom large in our collective memory. Many have detailed the exciting events of the Apollo program, but Launius offers unique insight into its legacy as seen through multiple perspectives. He surveys a wide range of viewpoints and narratives, both positive and negative, surrounding the program. These include the argument that Apollo epitomizes American technological--and political--progress; technological and scientific advances garnered from the program; critiques from both sides of the political spectrum about the program's expenses; and even conspiracy theories and denials of the program's very existence. Throughout the book, Launius weaves in stories from important moments in Apollo's history to draw readers into his analysis. <i>Apollo's Legacy</i> is a must-read for space buffs interested in new angles on a beloved cultural moment and those seeking a historic perspective on the Apollo program.</p><p>ROGER D. LAUNIUS is former associate director of collections and curatorial affairs at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. From 1990 to 2002, he served as chief historian of NASA. He has authored and coauthored numerous books, including<i> The Smithsonian History of Space Exploration</i>."As Launius analyzes critiques of the Moon landings and discusses Moon-landing denialism, he uses key moments in the space race to illustrate his analysis." <br>&#x2014;<i>American Scientist</i> <br><br>"Space Age aficionados, political junkies, and general readers will find both the unexpected and the fascinating in Launius&#x2019;s scrupulously researched account." <br>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly, </i>starred review <br><br>"The book also provides extensive background material on the space program, both from within NASA and from outside observers, as well as a useful annotated bibliography for those who want to do their own research. A valuable summary of an important piece of modern history and its effects and a must-read for space enthusiasts." <br> &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <i><br></i> <br>"Launius' insightful cultural analysis of all that Apollo has signified helps celebrate the first lunar landing's 50th anniversary." <br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> <br><i><br></i> "Roger D. Launius&#x2019;s Apollo&#x2019;s Legacy is a masterly written and impeccably researched overview of the Cold War space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Nobody knows NASA history with the insight and exactitude of Launius. Every page brims with fresh insights. Highly recommended!"<br>&#x2014;Douglas Brinkley, Katherine Tsanoff Brown Chair in Humanities and Professor of History, Rice University and author of <i>American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race</i><br><br>"An incredibly inspiring and well-researched story of the origins and accomplishments of the Apollo program, Launius&#x2019;s Apollo&#x2019;s Legacy is a superb tutorial for all of us who consider ourselves to be strong proponents of human exploration of the Moon and Mars. Replete with previously untold background stories of the battles to gain approval for Apollo and to manage its execution, this book is instructive on the contemporary challenges&#x2014;political and societal&#x2014;that we face in trying to maintain momentum for the continued pursuit of human journeys and settlement beyond low Earth orbit."<br>&#x2014;Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr. (US Marine Corps&#x2013;Ret.), 12th NASA Administrator<br><br>"With the perspective of half a century lived in the afterglow of the Apollo project, historian Launius provides a trenchant three-dimensional analysis, plotting Apollo&#x2019;s legacy over time against the axes of political left and right, and of legitimate triumph versus hoax-mongering. He brings to life the idealism that in unusual coalition joined innovation and geopolitics, as 'all the cosmic tumblers clicked into place to make possible successful Moon landings.'"<br>&#x2014;Don Eyles, Apollo engineer and author of <i>Sunburst and Luminary: An Apollo Memoir</i> <br><br>"That complex, critical perspective makes <i>Apollo&#x2019;s Legacy </i>stand out amid all the books that simply celebrate that glorious and revered event." <br>&#x2014;<i>The Space Review</i></p><h2>Aunt Dimity and The King&#39;s Ransom (Aunt Dimity Mystery)</h2><p><b><b>In this new installment of the bestselling Aunt Dimity series, a dark and stormy night kicks off a ghost chase in rural England </b></b><br><br>On a dull and dreary October day, Lori Shepherd and her husband Bill set off for the historic town of Rye, on the southeast coast of England, for a quiet weekend together without the kids. Bill must first pay a visit to a reclusive client--but after Lori drops him off, a powerful storm drives her off course and leaves her stranded in an ancient, rambling inn called The King's Ransom. When Lori is spooked by ghostly noises in the night, Aunt Dimity reminds her rather tartly that not all ghosts intend to harm the living. <br><br>But the longer Lori is stuck at the inn, the stranger things seem. She learns that the inn was once a hangout for smugglers, and that it's riddled with secret tunnels the smugglers used to reach a network of hidden caves. Then there's the inn's cook--a brawny, gruff ex-con--who seems to have a beef with a mysterious French guest. Are the noises Lori hears made by the spirits of long dead smugglers? Or should she be more worried by the inn's living inhabitants? Joining forces with her new friend Bishop Wyndham, and guided by Aunt Dimity's wise counsel, Lori sets out to discover once and for all who--or what--is haunting The King's Ransom.</p><p>Nancy Atherton is the bestselling author of twenty-three Aunt Dimity Mysteries.

She lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.<p>One</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was half past eleven on a blustery Tuesday night in mid-October. My ten-year-old sons were asleep in their room, my baby daughter was asleep in the nursery, and the family cat was asleep in my husband's favorite armchair. After a tumultuous evening involving a dead mouse, an emergency diaper change, and an illicit game of cricket in the living room, my husband and I had retreated to the master bedroom, but we weren't asleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bill was sitting upright against his pillows, perusing a sheaf of densely printed legal documents. It wasn't my idea of a riveting bedtime read, but as an estate attorney with a wealthy and demanding clientele, Bill sometimes had to bring his work to bed with him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn't mind. I was so tired that I wouldn't have cared if Bill had brought his bicycle to bed with him. I wasn't sure why I felt so weary, and I hoped that a good night's sleep would cure whatever ailed me, but in the meantime, I was beat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turned off the light in the bathroom, climbed into bed, and flopped back on my pillows with a heavy sigh. At the sound of my sigh, Bill set aside his papers and eyed me warily. Twelve years of married life had taught him to choose his next words with care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Something wrong, Lori?" he asked cautiously. "Besides the mouse, the exploding diaper, and the smashed vase, I mean."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No," I said, staring fixedly at the ceiling. "Nothing's wrong. Not one thing." I sighed again. "My life is perfect."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wasn't exaggerating. Apart from an occasional domestic disaster, my life was nothing short of a dream come true. My husband was the best of men, my children were as bright as they were healthy, and our cat was an excellent mouser. We lived in a fairy-tale cottage made of honey-colored stone near a picture-postcard village nestled snugly among the rolling hills and the patchwork fields of the Cotswolds, one of England's prettiest rural regions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although Bill and I were Americans, as were our twin boys, Will and Rob, and our baby, Bess, we'd lived near the small English village of Finch for more than a decade. Bill ran the international branch of his family's venerable Boston law firm from an office overlooking the village green; Will and Rob attended Morningside School in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping; and I juggled the ever-changing roles of wife, mother, friend, neighbor, and community volunteer. Nineteen-month-old Bess did what nineteen-month-olds do, which meant that Stanley, our sleek black cat, spent much of his time avoiding her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bill's father, William Willis, Sr., had made our happiness complete when he'd retired from his position as the head of the family firm and moved to England to be near his grandchildren. A handsome widower with courtly manners and a sizable bank account, Willis, Sr., had broken many a hopeful heart in Finch when he'd met and married his second wife, the well-known watercolorist Amelia Bowen. The pair lived in Fairworth House, a graceful Georgian mansion just up the lane from our cottage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finch was no more than a stone's throw from Willis, Sr.'s modest estate, across a humpbacked bridge that spanned the Little Deeping River. A stranger might mistake the village for a somnolent backwater, but those of us who called it home were never at a loss for something to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our spare time we fished from the banks of the Little Deeping, hiked the network of footpaths that crisscrossed the countryside, cycled sedately along the hedge-lined lanes, or took to the bridle paths on horseback. Bird-watching, metal detecting, and gardening were among the most popular hobbies in Finch, but a few of us made quilts or collected model trains or produced paintings that would never be mistaken for Amelia Bowen's.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When it came to communal activities, we were spoiled for choice. Art shows, flower shows, church fetes, and gymkhanas were but a few of the events that dotted the village calendar, and a plethora of committee meetings ensured that each event was well organized and well attended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we weren't fishing, hiking, cycling, horseback riding, pursuing our hobbies, or participating in villagewide events, we attended services at St. George's Church; shared pots of tea at Sally Cook's tearoom; shopped at Taxman's Emporium, Finch's grandly named general store; and dozed through committee meetings in the old schoolhouse, which served as our village hall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everywhere we went, we gossiped. Gossip was a way of life in Finch, and though it could at times be moderately mean-spirited, it was never cruel. More often than not the village grapevine was simply the most efficient way to spread local news, which was the only news we really cared about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I simply couldn't imagine a better place to live. My neighbors weren't angels, by any means, but they were fundamentally good. They'd welcomed Bill and me to their tight-knit community with open arms, and they'd opened them even wider to welcome our children. Will and Rob had the run of every cookie jar in Finch, and Bess was treated like everyone's favorite granddaughter. We could depend on our neighbors to come to our aid in any emergency, and they knew that they could always count on us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I even had a best friend living nearby. Like me, Emma Harris was an American, though, unlike me, she'd married an Englishman. Emma ran the riding school where Will and Rob took lessons and where we boarded their gray ponies, Thunder and Storm. Even-tempered and rational, Emma was in many ways my polar opposite, but in our case as in so many others, opposites attracted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"My life is perfect," I repeated to Bill. "I have a family who loves me and whom I adore. I live in a beautiful place among wonderful people. I'm valued at home and in my community, and my best friend lives five minutes away. I have no reason-and certainly no right-to complain about anything."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But . . . ?" Bill coaxed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But instead of looking forward to making four dozen butterscotch brownies for the bake sale on Saturday, I feel like a prisoner who's been sentenced to four dozen years of hard labor," I said, still gazing dully at the ceiling. "I don't know why. I usually enjoy baking."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bill studied my profile in silence, then hunkered down beside me and whispered in my ear, "Run away with me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What?" I said, startled out of my lassitude.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You need a break," he said, resting his head on his hand. "Even a perfect life gets old after a while. However pleasant a routine, it's still a routine, and routines are meant to be broken. You haven't been away from home since the long weekend we spent at The White Hart in Old Cowerton, and that was way back in July. You need a change of scene, a breath of fresh air, a chance to recharge your batteries."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Easier said than done," I muttered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Most things are," Bill retorted. "This particular thing, however, will be as easy as pie to accomplish."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I doubt it," I said. "I have an awful lot to do this week. It's not just the bake sale. I have to repaint the palm trees for the Nativity play, bottle jam with Emma, distribute books and magazines at the hospital, sort donations at the thrift shop-and that's on top of everything I have to do at home."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There isn't much empty space in my datebook, either," Bill said, "but if I can make room in it for a romantic getaway, so can you." He brushed a tousled curl back from my forehead. "I'm not taking no for an answer, Lori."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Apparently not." I rolled over to face him. "Are you about to reveal a cunning plan?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Naturally." He cocked his head toward the sheaf of legal papers he'd placed on the bedside table. "I have to drive down to East Sussex on Thursday to meet with a client. You can come with me. We'll stay at The Mermaid Inn in Rye, and we won't come home until Sunday."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My eyes widened. "The Mermaid Inn? I've always wanted to stay at The Mermaid Inn. It's supposed to be one of England's great historic inns."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So I've heard," said Bill. "We'll find out together. We'll explore Rye, too. There's a nature reserve on the edge of town that stretches right down to the sea. We can stroll along the shore and search the horizon for pirate ships or wander through Rye's cobbled streets and soak up its history."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I gazed at him rapturously. "A hotel oozing with atmosphere in a town reeking of history, all within sight of the sea? It sounds too good to be true."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I haven't mentioned the food yet," Bill went on. "The Mermaid Inn's restaurant has a stellar reputation. We can gorge on fine dining there, or we can sample the local fish and chips, or we can have every meal served to us in bed."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Please don't ask me to decide where we should eat," I said, groaning. "I don't have the energy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You will," Bill declared. "Until then, you can leave the decisions to me. How does a luxury suite with a fireplace and a four-poster bed sound?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"A working fireplace?" I asked hopefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Naturally. Then there's the claw-foot tub, the fluffy towels, the designer toiletries, the chocolates-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Stop!" I broke in, smiling. "Don't spoil the surprises!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll make an online reservation tonight," said Bill, "and I'll speak with Father in the morning. He and Amelia having been champing at the bit to have the children all to themselves for a few days."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We'll be lucky if they give them back," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We won't have to worry about Stanley, either," said Bill. "Amelia likes looking after him."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Amelia spoils him rotten," I said. "He'll feast on salmon, tuna, and minced shrimp while we're gone and go into mourning when we get back. But he'll get over it. He always does."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We'll take my Mercedes instead of your Range Rover," Bill proposed. "It'll make a nice change for you to travel in a car that isn't equipped with child safety seats."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Or littered with dinosaurs, cricket bats, and sippy cups," I added. "Good thinking."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The weather may not be optimal during our getaway," Bill cautioned. "It may be a bit drizzly in Rye."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"If we were afraid of rain, we wouldn't live in England," I reminded him. "And if the weather's too miserable, we'll light a fire in the hearth, curl up in our four-poster, and-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Stop," Bill interrupted, nuzzling my neck. "Don't spoil the surprises."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a brief intermission during which my gray mood lifted considerably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we were able to talk again, Bill's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There's only one catch," he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I knew it," I said as my murky mood threatened to return. "I knew there'd be a catch."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's a tiny catch," he assured me, "and it has to do with my client."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Your client?" I said, baffled. "The client you're seeing on Thursday?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's the one," Bill confirmed. "His name is Sir Roger Blayne and he lives in an Elizabethan manor house called Blayne Hall."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't see the catch," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The catch is that he's a recluse-a serious recluse," Bill explained. "The first time I met with Sir Roger, Father had to come with me to vouch for my identity."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Charming," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Our relationship has progressed by leaps and bounds since then," Bill assured me. "Instead of regarding me with distaste, Sir Roger tolerates me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Fairly small leaps and bounds, then," I observed drily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"My point is that Sir Roger sees no one but his physicians, his attorneys, and a handful of faithful retainers," said Bill. "Since you don't fall into any of those categories, I doubt that he'll let you into Blayne Hall."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll wait for you in the car," I suggested.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I have a better idea," Bill said. "You can drop me off on Sir Roger's doorstep, drive to Rye, check into The Mermaid Inn, and enjoy a long, lazy bubble bath in your claw-foot tub. When I'm done with Sir Roger, his chauffeur can drive me to Rye."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How far is it from Blayne Hall to Rye?" I queried. I wasn't wildly enthused about driving in the south of England, where the roads tended to resemble green trenches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No more than ten miles," Bill replied, "and the route is well signposted."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ten miles on well-marked roads?" I said. "That's hardly a catch at all." I snuggled closer to my husband. "I haven't taken a proper bubble bath since Bess was born."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I may join you in it," he warned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll keep the water hot for you," I purred.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hold that thought," he said. "I have to make a reservation!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As he rolled out of bed and reached for his laptop, I wrapped my arms around his pillow and heaved a blissful sigh. The elation I felt at the mere thought of running away from home told me that Bill's diagnosis was correct: I was badly in need of a break. I loved Finch dearly, but a change of scene would do me a world of good, especially when the scene encompassed bubble baths, seaside strolls, and a four-poster bed in a romantic inn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Who cares if it rains?" I murmured sleepily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As it turned out, I would.</p></p><h2>Mute: A Visual Document: From 1978 - Tomorrow</h2><p><p><strong>The authoritative, sumptuously illustrated history of Mute Records, a one-man label which helped launch Depeche Mode, Nick Cave, Goldfrapp, and many more</strong></p><p>Mute is one of the most revered and influential indie labels of all time.

Circus to small-town carnivals and big-city sideshows&#x2014;which is one of legend. Today, Schlitzie is most well-known for his appearance in the cult classic&nbsp;<i>Freaks</i>. The making of&nbsp;<i>Freaks&nbsp;</i>and Schlitzie&#x2019;s role in the film is a centerpiece of the book. In researching Schlitzie&#x2019;s life (1901&#x2013;1971), Griffith has tracked down primary sources and archives throughout the country, including conducting interviews with those who worked with him and had intimate knowledge of his personality, his likes and dislikes, how he responded to being a sideshow &#x201c;freak,&#x201d; and much more. This graphic novel biography provides never-before-revealed details of his life, offering a unique look into his world and restoring dignity to his life by recognizing his contributions to popular culture.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Bill Griffith&nbsp;</b>is the creator of the syndicated daily comic strip&nbsp;<i>Zippy</i>.

According to Bartlett, Griffith coined the popular phrase &#x201c;Are we having fun yet?&#x201d; He lives in Hadlyme, Connecticut.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;...virtuoso comic-strip artist Bill Griffith gives voice to a true outcast &#x2014; the sideshow attraction born Simon Metz (probably) in the Bronx (probably) in 1901. He fills the biographical lacunae with vivid info on the sideshow life, Hollywood in the &#x2019;30s, and linework so rich you could eat it...&nbsp;this is an uplifting, wonderfully humane book.&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The underlying message of&nbsp;<i>Nobody&#x2019;s Fool</i>? I get it&#x2014;underneath our grandiose opinions of ourselves we&#x2019;re all pinheads and freaks!&nbsp;<i>Nobody&#x2019;s Fool</i>&nbsp;is boffo! The best graphic novel of the year!&#x201d; (R.

Or, as Schlitzie would say, it's&nbsp;<i>boffo</i>!&#x201d; (<i>Booklist, Starred Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A tender biographical tribute to an artist&#x2019;s inspiration.&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;With dense cross-hatching and lively, expressive character design, Griffith&#x2019;s art straddles the line between absurdity and realism. Griffith gets at the central paradox at the heart of freak shows: while exploitative and demeaning, the shows created a loving, tight-knit community...&nbsp;Much like in Freaks, the revelation found in this illuminating work is that the true monsters are the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; people who line up to laugh at or abuse Schlitzie.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly, Starred Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Griffith is renowned for his absurdist comic strip Zippy the Pinhead, inspired by Schlitzie&#x2019;s iconic image, and on some level this biography seems to be an attempt at restoring some dignity to a life he&#x2019;s mined for his own purposes. He succeeds wonderfully.&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is the book Bill Griffith was destined to make. The tale of Schlitzie the Pinhead is one of surprising triumph&#x2014;an uplifting and heartfelt portrait of a simple man who finds joy in the strangest of lives.&nbsp;<i>Nobody&#x2019;s Fool</i>&nbsp;is a brilliant and fascinating work by a master storyteller.

This kindhearted and thoroughly interesting tribute to the man who inspired Griffith&#x2019;s Zippy is also a history of 20th-century American culture and social mores.&#x201d; (<i>Christian Science Monitor</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Bill Griffith&#x2019;s artistic investigation into the real life of Schlitzie Surtees in&nbsp;<i>Nobody&#x2019;s Fool</i>&nbsp;is as heartbreaking and poignant as his&nbsp;<i>Zippy the Pinhead</i>&nbsp;is hilarious and clever. The biography manages to be both gorgeous and tragic, a warts-and-all exploration of how this country has treated those with disabilities and challenges, while also being a meditation on the ephemerality of fame. The questions Griffith raises about the nature of exploitation, acceptance, and quality of life are haunting. A masterpiece of the medium.&#x201d; (Jake Tapper, anchor and chief Washington correspondent, CNN)<br><br>&#x201c;A masterpiece of absurdity and humanity.

Almaas uses the metaphor of the mysterious philosopher's stone to discuss a tremendous liberating power that leads to endless enlightenment.&nbsp;</b><br><br>For millennia alchemists sought the philosophers&#x2019; stone, the miracle substance believed to be the key to all the secrets of existence. The quest was fueled by some of the prime questions of human existence: What am I? Why am I here? How has this world come to be?<br><br>A. H. Almaas shows that the tremendous liberating power of the mysterious philosophers&#x2019; stone is closer to us than we realize. In fact, it is the true nature of all reality&#x2014;in all times and all places, without being limited to being anything in particular. Through the philosophers&#x2019; stone, real transformation can happen, our consciousness can become free, and we can open to all the possibilities of reality. <br><br> Almaas discusses the factors that are involved in igniting the catalytic property of the philosophers&#x2019; stone and then begins to unpack the properties of true nature when it is free of constraints. Finally, we are left with the revelation that true nature is endlessly knowable, and yet nothing we can know or say about it exhausts its mystery and power. The result is a new understanding of what liberation and practice are&#x2014;and a view of what it&#x2019;s like when seeking ceases and life becomes a process of continual discovery. We begin to appreciate that the freedom of reality expressed in the complete and fulfilled life all human beings seek&#x2014;and few find&#x2014;is actually the simplicity of the ordinary.</p><p>A. H. Almaas is the pen name of Hameed Ali, the Kuwaiti-born originator of the Diamond Approach, who has been guiding individuals and groups in Colorado, California, and Europe since 1976. He is the author of many books, including <i>The Power of Divine Eros</i>, <i>The Unfolding Now</i>,<i> </i>and<i> Runaway Realization.</i>"I<i>&nbsp;</i>am just loving<i>&nbsp;The Alchemy&nbsp;of&nbsp;Freedom.</i>&nbsp;A. H. Almaas tells it like it is, without neglecting how it seems to be. He eloquently describes the indescribable &#x2018;true nature&#x2019; of reality, as the &#x2018;philosophers&#x2019; stone,&#x2019; the key to the secret of existence, as enlightened, extraordinary ordinariness. He seems intriguingly to speak as if enlightened, yet, most importantly and blessedly, he does not claim &#x2018;enlightenment&#x2019; as his possession. He does not trap himself in what the Chan masters of old called &#x2018;the demon ghost cave&#x2019; of considering one&#x2019;s self to be enlightened, and so, set apart from life and above others. In fact, he manifests himself as open-minded, open-hearted, and ever curious. He clearly enjoys life through the exquisitely equalizing wisdom experience. The inconceivable voidness&#x2019;s compassionate, clearlight way seems to unfold him as its oracular mirror. I so much appreciate his teaching. I could go on, but better that he goes on with his lapidary guidance, and best that you all continue your own journey of discoveries with this great gift of a book!" -- Tenzin Robert A. F.

From its improvised studios and stages emerged the early expressions of Modernism: Cubism, Dada, Surrealism, incorporation of collage in painting and vernacular in poetry. Jacob&#x2019;s masterwork, The Dice Cup (Le Cornet � D�s), has never before been available in a full English edition. This completely new translation includes the Preface of 1916, with Jacob&#x2019;s critique of Rimbaud, Baudelaire and Mallarme, and his strictures and inspirations for the true prose poem: &#x201c;The author who has situated his work can use all the enchantments: language, rhythm, musicality and spirit.&#x201d; &#x201c;I am convinced that artistic emotion ceases where analysis and thought intersect: something else provokes thought and gives the feeling of beauty.&#x201d; &#x201c;A work of art is a force that attracts, that absorbs the available forces of the one who comes close to it.&#x201d; &#x201c;The poem is a constructed object... the prose poem is a jewel.&#x201d; from The Dice Cup: THE PRESS: I entered timidly: there was an ostrich that was losing its feathers and, on a white stucco pedestal, a bronze bird whose plumage was represented by a series of engraved shells. It was Mr. Abel Hermant or someone like Mr. Abel Hermant who appeared, as soon as the hallway door opened: &#x201c;Ah! young man!&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;you come for the hundred sous!&#x201d; I learned later that a hundred sous were given to everybody who came there. At the mention of a hundred sous, the ostrich dropped a feather and the bronze bird flew away. Anyway, the vestibule was deserted and dusty, pins were kept in iron boxes painted with the portraits of great men, Cuvier, Buffon, etc... &#x201c;Ah! Young man,&#x201d; repeated Mr. Abel Hermant or someone of the same ilk, &#x201c;you come for the hundred sous!&#x201d; And the birds re-commenced their motions. &#x201c;No, sir! It&#x2019;s free! It&#x2019;s a free delivery!&#x201d; My future spiritual guide did not listen any further: &#x201c;free delivery&#x201d; had edified him, he turned his back on me. The ostrich put on his policeman&#x2019;s hat and looked at me with worried curiosity. The bronze bird was even more bronze.</p><p></p><h2>Troop Leader: A Tank Commander&#39;s Story</h2><p>Bill Bellamy was a regular officer with the 8th King&#39;s Royal Irish Hussars from 1943 until 1955.

Confident that most people have the ability to express themselves artistically once they have acquired the right techniques, Richmond offers his tried-and-true methods of drawing and composition in this easy-to-follow guide.<br>"The short road to success" begins with a brush. Richmond advises novices to forego the use of a pencil, since it demands a higher degree of accuracy than the beginner possesses. When a brush is used, the ink glides over the paper easily and is more likely to bring desired results. Starting with simple lines and curves, then moving on to various elements&#x2014;from clouds and trees to castles and cottages&#x2014;Richmond offers exercises to train the eyes and hand to work together.

For three years, these men, women, and children had miraculously survived&#x2015;eluding Nazi hunts and Soviet, Polish, and Ukrainian partisans who often killed first and asked questions later. They had escaped from the Nazi ghettos and slave labor<br>camps and formed secret partisan camps in the surrounding forests. The forest not only protected them, it also became their base for sabotage and resistance efforts against the Germans and their allies. <br>Based on extensive research and numerous interviews with the survivors themselves, <em>Fugitives of the Forest</em> tells the harrowing and heroic story of those who resisted amid such perilous conditions. Some may ask the troubling question: why did not more Jews resist? But the question author-historian Allan Levine poses in this riveting, award-winning book is more apt: how, under the circumstances, was any resistance possible at all?

Challenging the predominant belief that people with Alzheimer&#39;s no longer have purpose, potential, or the capacity for meaningful relationship, Where Two Worlds Touch is both a spiritual memoir and a pastoral guide for those who love someone with Alzheimer&#39;s. Readers will find here the reassuring words of a friend who has been there and can give advice on preserving connection, finding hope, self-care, and staying open to the possibility of grace.</p><p><b>Rev. Dr. Jade Angelica</b> is the founder and director of the Healing Moments Alzheimer's Ministry (http://healingmomentswebsite.webs.com) and leads workshops, worship services, and trainings around the country. She holds a master of divinity degree from Harvard Divinity School, a certificate from the Shalem Institute Spiritual Guidance Program, and a doctor of ministry degree in Faith, Health and Spirituality from Andover Newton Theological School."Any caregiver who has felt duty-bound to support a spouse, parent, or other loved one with Alzheimer's disease will find a path to compassionate care as they follow Jade Angelica's personal transformation from a wounded, distant daughter to her mother's loving companion in <i>Where Two Worlds Touch</i>. Embedded in wisdom from a variety of spiritual traditions, Jade's inspirational story provides a new and hopeful way for caregivers to approach the daily challenges of Alzheimer's disease and connect meaningfully with loved ones." --<b>Cordula Dick-Muehlke</b>, Associate Clinical Professor, Department of Family Medicine and Division of Geriatrics, University of California, Irvine School of Medicine<br><br>"<i>Where Two Worlds Touch</i> is a timely manifesto that will forever change the way our society cares for individuals with dementia. This is a must-read book for all caretakers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Angelica is a prescient observer of the human condition and has done a wonderful job of providing rich anecdotes, clear prose, and novel strategies that really work. Given that there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, it is imperative that our society develop and follow a humane standard of care for these individuals. Where Two Worlds Touch provides a blueprint for how we can ameliorate the suffering and dramatically improve the quality of life for Alzheimer's patients." --<b>Justin Feinstein</b>, Clinical Neuropsychologist, Laureate Institute for Brain Research<br><br>"<i>Where Two Worlds Touch</i> is a perfect blend of sacred/spiritual and everyday insight for caregivers. Angelica bravely describes her relationship with her mother pre-dementia, helping readers to understand that they can have meaningful relationships with loved ones who have Alzheimer's, even when those relationships have been fraught with difficulty in the past. The book offers practical tools, such as improvisational techniques, and spiritual reflection to help readers transform the lives of people with dementia and their own lives as well. Angelica helps care partners to approach people with dementia in a creative way that does not focus on what the person cannot do. Instead, the focus is on entering into the person's reality, which often leaves us surprised, excited, and humbled at the abilities and memories that remain." --<b>Melanie Chavin</b>, Vice President of Program Services, Alzheimer's Association, Greater Illinois Chapter<br><br>"I am so very impressed by this exceptionally well-written and well-researched book.

Stern</b>, Clinical Core Director, Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center, Boston University School of Medicine<br><br>"Inspiring! Angelica's day-to-day journey with her Mom through Alzheimer's to death is a deeply informative story of caring and growing in the process. Through the sharing of her story she makes a profound case for the need to be with and for another who suffers from the disease. She also gives many clues about how to do it. I suggest that it's a "must read" for anyone who has a family member or friend with Alzheimer's, and for everyone who works with Alzheimer's patients as a nurse, an aide, or volunteer." --<b>Janaan Manternach</b>, co-author, <i>Alzheimer's Disease: A Handbook for Caregivers, Family and Friends</i><br><br>"The consciousness-raising and worldview-shifting insights found in <i>Where Two Worlds Touch</i> might have a positive systemic impact on society if it were to become the go-to book for those whose lives are touched by Alzheimer's." -<b>Patty Sutherland</b>, <i>ForeWord Reviews</i><br><br>"Jade Angelica has written an intensely personal yet also universally applicable treatment of Alzheimer's disease that is real, honest, and wise. Blending sound research with helpful and often moving accounts of caring (in every sense of the word) for those with Alzheimer's, her writing is clear and engaging and provides a great deal of practical advice." --<b>Stephen Sapp</b>, Professor of Religious Studies, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL<br><br>"Grounded in research and inspired by poetry, spiritual insight, and personal reflection, this testimony to the transforming power of love touches at the root of what makes us human--the ability to maintain relationship despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Jade Angelica's indomitable spirit uses every means available to her creative imagination to seek and eventually find a means to heal and be healed through relationship with her mother, who is succumbing to the diminishments of Alzheimer's Disease. This is spiritual direction at its best--alert to Divine guidance while attending to present-moment reality. Ms. Angelica allows knowledge to remain in the background as she deftly gains insight into the nuanced communication of her slowly diminishing mother. Warmly, open-heartedly, keenly, perseveringly, their relationship yields to mutual transformation. This is a testimony to the power of love at work in those who willingly receive. Thank you to Jade Angelica for this witness to the power of the human spirit to prevail in the midst of chaos, darkness, and confusion--a true story of the reality of resurrection for those vulnerable enough to see."--<b>Martha L. Campbell</b>, Former Director, Spiritual Guidance Program, Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation, Washington, DC<br><br>"Angelica's life story as an estranged daughter, a Harvard theological student, and eventually the primary caregiver for her mom has led her to a place where she can hold the hands of other caregivers and share her hopeful credo, that two worlds can indeed touch, even if one world is altered by distance and disease. I have decided to gift each of my support group members with a copy of Where Two Worlds Touch." --<b>Joanne Koenig Coste</b>, author of <i>Learning to Speak Alzheimer's</i><br><br>"Jade Angelica captures the essence of being an Alzheimer's care partner. She transforms a task frequently perceived as complex, difficult, and discouraging, into one that is a joyful, rewarding experience for both partners.

You will just keep growing." <p> -- Gail Sheehy, author of <i>Passages</i> </p><p> from <b>Chapter 1 All About Eve: The Birth of a Notion</b> </p><p> I got the determination to write <i>Aging Gratefully</i> after <i>Grand</i> magazine named me one of the top ten sexiest grandparents in the world. The list included Mick Jagger, Pierce Brosnan, Goldie Hawn, and Harrison Ford. I was proud to be included in what was a celebration of aging, and proof positive that Baby Boomers can be vital, exciting, healthy, productive, and yes, even sexy in their later years 'cause that's how I feel. </p><p> But the notion had already been brewing from my disquiet at society's growing prejudice against aging. Every time we see someone over fifty (if we see them at all) on television or in magazines, they're typically marginalized, or somehow portrayed as feeble or useless. Nothing could be farther from the truth! The first time Wy and I went to the fun house at the state fair while performing as the Judds, we were bemused at our grotesque images in the fun-house mirrors. But now this is how society's distorted reflection of aging feels today. Wy and I kept bumping into mirrors trying to navigate the maze. Suddenly we almost collided and Wy raised her hand to my face. Wondering aloud, she asked, "Are you real?" </p><p> <b><i>Being Real</i></b> </p><p> The number one cause of mental illness and unhappiness is not knowing who you are. This book is about looking in the mirror of truth and realizing and embracing who you are in mind and body and spirit. So instead of the most expensive over-the-counter cream or a visit to a plastic surgeon, think of these choices as your most effective weapon against <i>fear</i> of aging. Grab your bifocals or magnifying glasses and let's learn our options. I'm going to show you Grandma ain't what she used to be. </p><p> My friend Lily Tomlin says, "Anyone who writes a self-help book should first be able to prove they've helped themselves." So to begin every chapter, I'll reveal the personal story of my own experiences through the years. First I want to introduce you to a girl from my past named Naomi (name not a coincidence, as you will soon discover). She was a fellow student at Crabbe Grade School in Ashland, Kentucky. She was slow and unlovely. Every day I watched as Naomi walked by herself to our old stone schoolhouse. By contrast, as long as I can remember, people have told me how pretty I am. Seems it's only served to make me even more aware of how little external appearances mean. I didn't do anything to earn the looks or IQ with which I was born. Neither did Naomi. Neither did you. </p><p> We didn't get to choose the body or face with which we are born. Nor can we stop time from moving on. Somehow, even when I was in my early twenties, I intuited that basic reality. Maybe it was because I was in Hollywood, where I was becoming more and more upset about seeing people, especially women, allow themselves to be defined by our ever-changing, superficial culture. Thank goodness I began looking inward for my identity. I immediately felt less desperate. I realized that whenever I look at the fun-house mirror of society, I can remember it's only a distortion. </p><p> As I searched to figure out my values, I realized I value helping others. I left Hollywood to move us to Kentucky. My inner knowing steered me toward choosing to go to college and get a nursing degree. I valued a career in which character and caring matter more than the gift of genes. My patients didn't care what my face looked like, how old I was, or how much I weighed. </p><p> Shift happens. With this shift in my awareness, I felt more confident and more and more in control of my true self-image. I felt so much better about my future! I even went so far as to change my name from Diana Ellen Judd to Naomi Ellen Judd. Looking back, this early decision to change my first name, in recognition of that other Naomi (who still reminds me to be grateful) has helped preserve my sanity. I couldn't predict in the seventies that I would later be getting into the grandmother of all superficial and vain careers, showbiz. Somehow I have found my way in this most ageist of professions. I'm happier today at sixty-one than I've ever been. The critical steps I've learned along my journey are the ones I'm eager to share with you, dear reader. </p><p> It was a life-affirming breakthrough when I saw I could choose not to allow the culture, media, and some ad agency to impose harmful, unrealistic views and ideas about beauty, size, and age on me. Ever since then, I'm okay with growing older. I see it as something I'm going toward, rather than something to run away from. You can't stop the river, let's go with the flow. I've had a lot of ups and downs in my life -- married and with a child at eighteen, struggles with money and inappropriate men as a single mom, fame, fortune, and marriage to a wonderful man in my late thirties, forced retirement due to a supposed terminal illness in my late forties, and then the reinvention of myself as an author and a speaker, and with my own TV show in my fifties. I've survived so much stuff that my personal history (her story) is a testament to how not to sweat the stuff that's out of your control. When I can't control outer circumstances, I choose to change your reaction. That means you and I can change our reaction to aging too. </p><p> Aging is one of those things that you just can't control. As you and I grow older, changes in our physical appearance, as well as our mental capacity, are inevitable. Entropy isn't what it used to be (pun intended). We can't bargain with the clock, but we can react by making the best choices. One most important choice is to choose to be at peace with ourselves <i>exactly</i> as we are. </p><p> In this uncertain time of post 9/11, we certainly have enough to be insecure about. You and I don't need to be worrying about sagging bust lines and crow's-feet. I want to show you, whatever your age, that you can feel great, live fully, and be comfortable with and even embrace aging. So many of the answers to living well and longer lie within our minds. It's all about perspective and perception. This book is about all the ways you get to control your reaction. </p><p> I'm a straight shooter. If you really want to be the best you can be at whatever your age is right now, you must look in the mirror of truth about your own misconceptions. To get what you want, you need to identify what you don't want. When asked how he sculped the famous statue of David, Michelangelo replied, "I just got rid of everything that wasn't David." </p><p> Gerontologist Alex Comfort claimed that what we consider "aging" is only 25 percent the result of actual changes in body and mind; the rest is caused by the negative stereotypes placed on older folks. That's what my well-researched message is all about. First, how to recognize and say no to all the ridiculous stereotypes in the media about aging and figure out your own bias. Then to illuminate what your realistic choices are to have the best body, mind, and spirit you can, from now on. Through my personal stories of being in the media and a gathering of the best scientific data, you'll discover your own uniqueness to age gratefully and gracefully. Each chapter ends with Your Turn Now, for you to reflect on the new information and process it into an expanded way of thinking and behaving. </p><p> In these pages you will discover the role genetics and environment play in the aging process. Did you know that genetics are just 30 percent responsible in determining how long you live? Behavioral choices are the other 70 percent. (And by the time you hit fifty, lifestyle accounts for 80 percent of how you age!) As my friend Dr. Francis Collins said after his group decoded the human genome, "We're not marionettes being directed by our genes. We have free will to make daily choices." </p><p> What Dr. Collins's historic scientific discovery means is that the choices you and I make every day matter the most in how long and well we live. For example, heart disease is the number one cause of death, but 70 percent of arterial aging is preventable. Fifty percent of illnesses associated with aging (diabetes, broken bones, heart attack, and more) can be prevented. You'll learn about the differences between chronological and biological aging and what commonsense choices you can make to be healthier in body, mind, and spirit. </p><p> You'll find out the secrets of some of the healthiest old people on the planet -- the Okinawans, who are fit and functioning into their nineties and beyond. Doctors who've studied them claim that 80 percent of the nation's coronary units, one-third of the cancer wards, and a lot of the nursing homes would be shut down if Americans made choices more like these elders. And you'll meet several others groups of fabulously long-living folks -- a group of nuns, for instance, whose inner lives have been studied for decades, as well as folks who have been tracked by Harvard for over fifty years. They'll point us in the direction of what emotional and spiritual qualities we can begin cultivating and specific behaviors to stay vigorous and become happier throughout our entire existence. </p><p> You'll even see why practicing gratitude is so important and how an everyday simple act of being generous can add years to your life. </p><p> We'll also address the challenges of caring for parents while we're aging. I'll offer steps to deal with the grief that comes with loss, and explain how to nurture friendships and romantic love through the life span. And of course you'll be hearing from me about what I am learn- </p><p> ing from my own personal adventure of aging and inside stories of celebrity friends. Since laughter is such a life enhancer, I intend that we have a rollicking good time along the way.

They were a sombre and sober group, ten men and three women, who wore hiking clothes and impressively stacked backpacks. An astute observer would have noted that their clothes and gear were all new, and that several showed signs of blisters due to their boots not being properly worn in, and that none looked happy in a woollen hat. There were no observers, however, for the flatlands are unutterably tedious and usually lacking in things worth the observing.</p> <p>Their leader paused and consulted the map again. This took the form of a large square of predominantly blank paper upon which the legend and gridlines had consumed far more ink in the printing than any physical features. There were a few paths&#x2014;even to call them &#x2018;lanes&#x2019; would be an aggrandisement&#x2014;a few ditches with pretensions towards being streams, and one long earthwork that travelled into the centre of the map and then petered out, as so many things in the flatlands tended to. Drystone walls, interest, lives&nbsp;&#x2026; all fading away.</p> <p>At least the earthwork had the decency to stick up: a long railway bed for a spur line to nowhere, abandoned decades before. They could see it was heavily overgrown on the steep sides of the artificial ridge, but there were also signs that, relatively recently, much of the heavier undergrowth had been cut back or felled. They clambered up onto its top, past the unhealthy bushes and saplings that grew there, and found themselves on the rail bed itself, still bearing&#x2014;slightly surprisingly&#x2014;sleepers and tracks. Even more surprisingly, there was a train there, hidden behind the trees and shrubs.</p> <p>This discovery certainly surprised the hiking party, and even overawed them. The locomotive, although matte with rust the shade of dried blood, still exuded an air of exultant mechanical malevolence, as if somebody had crammed a black dragon into a giant jelly mould in the form of a steam locomotive and, with the wave of a wand, transformed the creature into the machine. But no; a wand would be insufficient. A magic staff perhaps. Or an enchanted caber. In any event, the iron dragon now slumbered in the sleep of years. Behind it was a train of assorted carriages, flatbeds, and freight cars, all once painted in black with red detailing, the exquisite work now peeling and forlorn. Just readable on the side of one of the cars was the legend <i>The World Renowned Cabal Bros. Carnival</i>.</p> <p>The leader of the group looked at the words for a long moment, and then smirked a very superior smirk of the type that starts at the corner of the mouth and finishes with trouble.</p> <p>&#x2018;This is the place,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Start the search.&#x2019;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The search went uncommented upon by passersby because there were no passersby. The flatlands went nowhere in either geographical or metaphorical terms, and no one went into them without the explicit intent to come out again, quickly. It was, in theory, an ideal place for footpads to operate, but the lack of potential victims had always kept its criminal population low, dwindling to none in relatively recent times. So there was nobody to see as twelve hikers, chivvied on by the thirteenth, dutifully dumped their packs, split the area into a search grid, produced strangely wrought weights on lengths of cord from identical pouches each had in their duffel coat pockets, and proceeded to methodically dowse the squares of the grid one by one. As an activity, it combined the mundane with the strange with the clandestine, and thereby rendered itself sinister. This was fair, for their intentions were sinister.</p> <p>Nor was their apparent efficiency a chimera. Within ten minutes one of the hikers was excitingly calling to their leader. He came over, as did the others, to see the hiker&#x2019;s plumb weight swinging in a manner harsh and angular, showing a brutalist disregard for physics that would have made Galileo enter the priesthood. They watched it twitch in silence, watched it marking out a pentacle in the air.</p> <p>&#x2018;Here?&#x2019; whispered the hiker, aquiver with excitement.</p> <p>&#x2018;Here,&#x2019; said their leader with magisterial certainty.</p> <p>Again, their activities were efficient yet strange. Quickly they doffed duffel coats and woolly hats and map cases. Quickly they donned robes and then struggled to strip naked beneath them like a charabanc party changing at the beach of a Whitsun weekend. When the undignified hopping and kicking off of trousers was complete, they hastened to create a circle of blue powder about the spot they had detected, and then they gathered around it as the dying sun sank beneath the horizon. It wasn&#x2019;t a happy circle&#x2014;they were now all barefooted and the area was scattered with chippings from the rail bed&#x2014;but it was a disciplined one, and they awaited the words of their leader.</p> <p>When they came, they were incomprehensible.</p> <p><i>&#x2018;Vateth He&#x2019;em!&#x2019;</i> he cried, excellent projection betraying a thwarted career in the theatre. <i>&#x2018;Oomaloth T&#x2019;y&#x2019;araskile!&#x2019;</i> And so he continued, booming forth an apparently endless litany of dreadful names and imprecations from memory, all bedewed with apostrophes. The hikers-turned-cultists chanted the occasional response, a <i>&#x2018;Gilg&#x2019;ya!&#x2019;</i> here and a <i>&#x2018;Ukriles!&#x2019;</i> there, and kept their eyes turned to the ground, for the grey skies were darkening and a wind was rising. Something was coming, and none dared to see its arrival.</p> <p>Around them, the air swirled, centring upon the blue circle. The powder was blown, yet remained in the place, stray motes caught and carried back into it. The breeze was not dispersing the circle; it was concentrating it.</p> <p>The landscape flickered under silent lightning, and those present scented a change in the air, a mixture of rage and blood that dizzied the mind and turned the stomach. Something wrathful was coming, a creature of death, and their fear was mixed with triumph, for all this was planned. The wind turned and dust was drawn in from their surroundings, drawn in from across the circle to grow in the middle, skittering particles the colour of bone, dancing from their hiding places between stones and from the soil itself. Nearby, a tattered and faded jacket fluttered where it lay at the base of the earthwork.</p> <p>Then, with a roar that they felt rather than heard, the circle was filled, and they all fell silent in the awful presence, an aching tintinnabulation of the soul sounding a single peal within their hearts that turned their knees weak with dread as it faded.</p> <p>&#x2018;Master,&#x2019; said the leader of the cultists. It came out weakly, his mouth and throat dry. He swallowed and tried again, stumbling over his carefully prepared words. &#x2018;Master, you bless us with your baleful&nbsp;&#x2026; personage. We fall in obeisance before you.&#x2019;</p> <p>It took a moment before they collectively realised that they&#x2019;d forgotten to fall, and there were a few seconds of hasty kneeling and sharp intakes of breath as bare knees found jagged gravel.</p> <p>The leader was belatedly realising that he could have organised the circle a little better before now and he was reduced to hissing urgently, &#x2018;The sacrifices! The sacrifices!&#x2019; until the three women in the group were gathered before the monster in the circle.</p> <p>&#x2018;Master,&#x2019; said the leader, eager to recover face, &#x2018;Lord of the Dead. Please accept these sacrifices we humbly offer you, that you may feed and gain strength after your long and dreamless sleep.&#x2019; He lowered his head and hoped that three would be enough. Even among their fanatical ranks, it had proved difficult to find three who would willingly sacrifice themselves for the greater good.</p> <p>Then the Lord of the Dead spoke.</p> <p>And he said, &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m not a bit peckish. Famished, in fact. But not nearly as much as I&#x2019;m surprised. And naked. I don&#x2019;t suppose anyone thought to bring along a spare pair of trousers, did they? There are ladies present, and I was raised to believe that being naked in front of strange ladies is something reserved for special occasions.&#x2019;</p> <p>They had not, in fact, remembered to bring along any clothes for the Lord of the Dead, indicating another failure in planning that would later result in some sharply worded memos. One of the cultists was, however, about the same size as the Lord of the Dead, and was pleased to give him a change of clothes from his pack. The Lord of the Dead thanked him and promised that he would give them back, freshly laundered, as soon as he was able. The cultist said it was fine, really. The Lord of the Dead insisted, and also said that everybody should stop calling him &#x2018;Master&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Lord of the Dead&#x2019;, and just call him &#x2018;Horst&#x2019; instead, because that was his name.</p> <p>&#x2018;My Lord Horst,&#x2019; said the leader, who was slightly scandalised that any puissant supernatural force of darkness and destruction should want to be on first-name terms so early in their acquaintance, &#x2018;you <i>must</i> feed.&#x2019;</p> <p>It was true; Horst did not look well after his period as dust. His eyes were sunken deep within their sockets and bone showed beneath the parchment of his skin. He looked like a corpse in the mid-stages of mummification, and his borrowed trousers would not stay up without assistance.</p> <p>The three women who knelt at his bony feet were quickly running through personal variants of &#x2018;It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done&#x2019;, and drew back their cowls and exposed their jugulars to him.</p> <p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; said Horst, shaking his head slowly, the best speed his desiccated neck could manage. &#x2018;No, no, no. That&#x2019;s not enough.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Not&nbsp;&#x2026; enough?&#x2019; The leader looked around the circle of his acolytes and saw faces as worried as his own. &#x2018;How many will you require?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, if I just feed from these three&nbsp;&#x2026; Hello, ladies&nbsp;&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll kill them, and that&#x2019;s not very polite. If I take a little from all of you, nobody has to die. I&#x2019;m sure everybody would be happier with that, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x2019;</p> <p>The leader was slightly baffled. &#x2018;But, master&#x2026;&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Horst.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;My Lord Horst, you are the embodiment of Death. You live without breath or vital spark in the umbral shadows, you are the wolf that preys upon we mortal cattle, you are&#x2026;&#x2019; The leader&#x2019;s voice was no longer very magisterial, just petty and wheedling. &#x2018;Well, you&#x2019;re a <i>vampire</i>, damn it. We brought these three here specially.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure their mothers&nbsp;&#x2026; Hello, ladies&nbsp;&#x2026; didn&#x2019;t raise them to be all-you-can-eat buffets. As for me, I&#x2019;ve beaten up a few people in my time, but I&#x2019;ve never killed anyone. Never felt the need to. I&#x2019;m not saying I&#x2019;m incapable of it, but it&#x2019;s not something I&#x2019;ve ever really aspired to, yes?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;But you&#x2019;re the Lord of the Dead!&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; said the monster in the loose clothes. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m Horst Cabal, and I don&#x2019;t murder for the sake of a snack. Now, as you pointed out, I need to feed. I shall only take what each of you can spare.&#x2019;</p> <p>The leader was feeling peevish that the sacrifice that he had so selflessly ordered others to make was being snubbed. &#x2018;We dragged those three all the way out here for nothing,&#x2019; he muttered furiously under his breath. Unhappily for him, inhumanly sharp senses are common amongst vampiric folk.</p> <p>&#x2018;I think,&#x2019; said Horst, regarding the leader with a wolfish expression, &#x2018;we&#x2019;ll start with you, shall we? Leading from the front, and all that.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Me?&#x2019; The leader was certainly intending to protest in the strongest terms, but then he made the mistake of looking at Horst&#x2019;s eyes and whatever he had been intending was lost in a sudden simplification of his mind&#x2019;s working.</p> <p>Horst flicked back the leader&#x2019;s cowl with an offhand gesture, took hold of his hair, and pulled his head back to expose his throat. &#x2018;Yes. You.&#x2019; Horst&#x2019;s lips parted and unusually long canine teeth showed as he leaned in. He paused and said to the silent onlookers, &#x2018;The rest of you, form an orderly queue.&#x2019;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>About halfway through the ad hoc transfusion session, Horst noticed that those that had already donated were clearly envied by those that hadn&#x2019;t, and those that hadn&#x2019;t were being patronised by those that had. He wondered vaguely if, in the time he had been away, vampirism had become fashionable. How long <i>had</i> he been away, exactly?</p> <p>He was feeling sated before he had finished with the ninth. Not completely revivified, he knew, but he was conscious of taking too much too quickly. He had been careful the first time he had drunk blood, and that had proved wise. It would prove equally wise to stop now, but then he looked at the faces of Victims 10&#x2013;13 and felt he couldn&#x2019;t let them down. Sighing inwardly, he finished with 9 and wearily gestured over 10. It would just be a nip, but at least duty would be honoured. His situation was not improved by 13, the third of the women, who insisted on making orgasmic noises at the first graze of his fangs. Under the circumstances, it seemed ungentlemanly to be perfunctory, and so he soldiered on until she&#x2019;d run out of expressions of passion. He straightened up, feeling replete, reborn, and generally resanguinated, but also irked that performance anxiety should pursue a fellow beyond the grave.</p> <p>&#x2018;So,&#x2019; he said as the cultists&#x2014;practically, if unromantically&#x2014;passed around a box of sticking plasters, &#x2018;now what?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;We must take you to the castle with all dispatch, my lord,&#x2019; said the leader, who it transpired was called Encausse.</p> <p>&#x2018;The castle. Of course. Should have known there would be a castle involved. Which particular castle would that be?&#x2019;</p> <p>Encausse looked uncomfortable, and Horst guessed he was wrestling between a conspirator&#x2019;s natural desire for secrecy and a conspirator&#x2019;s equally natural desire to tell everyone how brilliant the conspiracy is. &#x2018;I am not permitted to say, my lord.&#x2019;</p> <p>Horst considered softening his mind a little until the concept of &#x2018;permission&#x2019; became more malleable, but reined in the impulse. After all, that was the sort of thing real monsters did, and Horst didn&#x2019;t care for it.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, is it far?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, my lord. It will take several days to transport you there. I am sorry.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;For what?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;The inconvenience.&#x2019;</p> <p>Horst looked down at his newly reconstituted hands, and rubbed them in the manner of one getting down to brass tacks. &#x2018;The inconvenience&nbsp;&#x2026; Well, don&#x2019;t be too hard on yourself. You&#x2019;ve resurrected me, which was decent of you. We&#x2019;ll just consider ourselves even between that and the inconvenience.&#x2019;</p> <p>Horst was finding all manner of things not to like about the situation, and nestling high upon the parapets of his misgivings was why such a band of well-equipped and well-informed eccentrics had gone to all this trouble in the first place. For the first time he felt a small pang in his slowly beating heart. He hoped Johannes was still alive somewhere and he wished he could be here. All this occult malarkey was much more his brother&#x2019;s meat and drink. Johannes would have identified the group concerned, insulted everyone, and probably settled into a spirited gunfight by this juncture. The pang troubled Horst again; to his profound surprise, he was missing his brother.</p> <p>He looked at Encausse and saw the man was nervous. Horst guessed he&#x2019;d got it into his head that vampires kill people willy-nilly for every little disappointment. Perhaps they usually did. How would he know? Nobody had ever given him an induction lecture or even a pamphlet on the subject. He spoke to defuse the tension as much as anything. &#x2018;And how do you intend to get me to this castle? I think my passport has probably run out by now and, anyway, wouldn&#x2019;t being dead invalidate it?&#x2019;</p> <p>Encausse waved away the point, his relief at not being s...</p></p><h2>Xerxes: The Fall of the House of Darius and the Rise of Alexander</h2><p><b><b>This historical epic, set in the world of </b><b><i>300,</i></b><b> tells of the upsurge and decline of the Persian King's empire, and the ascent of the Grecian realm through Alexander.</b><br><b></b><br><b>Written and illustrated by comics luminary and legend, Frank Miller (</b><b><i>Sin City, The Dark Knight, 300</i></b><b>), and colored by Alex Sinclair (</b><b><i>Batman: The Dark Knight III: The Master Race</i></b><b>), this companion to Miller's epic masterpiece, </b><b><i>300,</i></b><b> brings the historical story of </b><b><i>Xerxes</i></b><b> to the graphic novel audience with grit and visual style!</b></b><br><br>The ongoing Greek rebellion against Persian tyranny reaches a turning point after the destruction of the city of Sardis and the later battle of Marathon: on a military campaign to vanquish the city of Athens and silence the Greeks once and for all, Xerxes, Persian Prince, watches as his father, King Darius, falls in battle . . . The mantle of king is passed and while his newly-inherited fleet retreats toward home, Xerxes' hatred is cemented toward Athens--and his incentive to build the Persian empire is fueled. Xerxes becomes the king of all countries--the king of Persia, ruler of Zion, and Pharoah of Egypt--and his empire is unlike any the world has ever seen, until . . . The mantle is again passed, the god king dies and Darius III continues as the king of all. But then, from the west, a tiger force strikes in Asia Minor and is on a course for collision with Persian forces. This will be the beginning of the end for Persia and the launch of Alexander the Great's rise to power!</p><p>Frank Miller began his career in comics in the late 1970s, first drawing then writing Daredevil for Marvel Comics, creating what was essentially a crime comic disguised as a superhero book. It was on Daredevil that Miller gained notoriety, honed his storytelling abilities, and took his first steps toward becoming a giant in the comics medium. After Daredevil came Ronin, a science-fiction samurai drama that seamlessly melded Japanese and French comics traditions into the American mainstream; and after that, the groundbreaking and acclaimed Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year One, both of which not only redefined the classic character, but also revitalized the industry itself. Finally able to fulfill his dream of doing an all-out, straight-ahead crime series, Miller introduced Sin City in 1991. Readers responded enthusiastically to Miller&#39;s tough-as-leather noir drama, creating an instant sales success. His multi-award-winning 300 series from Dark Horse, a telling of history&#39;s most glorious and underreported battle, was brought to full-blooded life in 1998. In 2001, Miller returned to the superhero genre with the best-selling Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again. Frank Miller continues to push the medium into new territories, exploring subject matter previously untouched in comics, and his work consistently receives the highest praise from his industry peers and readers everywhere. In 2005, with the hugely successful Sin City movie release, co-directed with Robert Rodriguez, Miller added a director&#39;s credit to his already impressive resum� and introduced his characters to an entirely new legion of fans worldwide.</p><h2>The 12-Week Diabetes Cookbook: Your Super Simple Plan for Organizing, Budgeting, and Cooking Amazing Dinners</h2><p>Looking for a way to organize all your meals for a week?

Set against the backdrop of the Meiji Restoration, it tells the saga of Himura Kenshin, once an assassin of ferocious power, now a humble <i>rurouni</i>, a wandering swordsman fighting to protect the honor of those in need.&nbsp;<br><br>A hundred and fifty years ago in Kyoto, amid the flames of revolution, there arose a warrior, an assassin of such ferocious power he was given the title <i>Hitokiri</i>: Manslayer. With his bloodstained blade, Hitokiri Battosai helped close the turbulent Bakumatsu period and end the reign of the shoguns, slashing open the way toward the progressive Meiji Era.&nbsp; Then he vanished, and with the flow of years became legend. <br><br>In the 11th year of Meiji, in the middle of Tokyo, the tale begins. Himura Kenshin, a humble <i>rurouni</i>, or wandering swordsman, comes to the aid of Kamiya Kaoru, a young woman struggling to defend her father's school of swordsmanship against attacks by the infamous Hitokiri Battosai. But neither Kenshin nor Battosai are quite what they seem...</p><p>He won an honourable mention prize in the Shonen Jump. &#34;New Manga Hop Step Award&#34; with the work Podomakku.

In this first in-depth exploration of Baldwin&#x2019;s &#x201c;Turkish decade,&#x201d; Magdalena J. Zaborowska reveals the significant role that Turkish locales, cultures, and friends played in Baldwin&#x2019;s life and thought. Turkey was a nurturing space for the author, who by 1961 had spent nearly ten years in France and Western Europe and failed to reestablish permanent residency in the United States. Zaborowska demonstrates how Baldwin&#x2019;s Turkish sojourns enabled him to re-imagine himself as a black queer writer and to revise his views of American identity and U.S. race relations as the 1960s drew to a close.<p></p><p>Following Baldwin&#x2019;s footsteps through Istanbul, Ankara, and Bodrum, Zaborowska presents many never published photographs, new information from Turkish archives, and original interviews with Turkish artists and intellectuals who knew Baldwin and collaborated with him on a play that he directed in 1969. She analyzes the effect of his experiences on his novel <i>Another Country</i> (1962) and on two volumes of his essays, <i>The Fire Next Time</i> (1963) and <i>No Name in the Street </i>(1972), and she explains how Baldwin&#x2019;s time in Turkey informed his ambivalent relationship to New York, his responses to the American South, and his decision to settle in southern France. <i>James Baldwin&#x2019;s Turkish Decade</i> expands the knowledge of Baldwin&#x2019;s role as a transnational African American intellectual, casts new light on his later works, and suggests ways of reassessing his earlier writing in relation to ideas of exile and migration.</p></p><p>"Illustrated with stunning photographs, James Baldwin's Turkish Decade presents fascinating and little-known details about Baldwin's Turkey and offers a new way of reading his works from the 1960s to the early 1970s. A small, throwaway reference to Istanbul in Another Country now appears momentous."--Werner Sollors, Henry B. and Anne M. Cabot Professor of English and African American Studies, Harvard University <p>"Magdalena J. Zaborowska's excellent scholarship unearths new and little-known material about James Baldwin's time in Turkey, particularly through her interviews with Baldwin's friends and colleagues in Istanbul. Her original analyses of Baldwin's work in the context of his Turkish experiences are also outstanding."--David Leeming, author of James Baldwin: A Biography</p>&#34;Drawing on oral history, archival research, literary analysis, cultural studies, and personal narrative/(auto)ethnography, Magdalena J. Zaborowska renders a multitextured reading of James Baldwin&#39;s years in Istanbul. No one else has so thoroughly examined the influence of those years on Baldwin&#39;s work, and anyone who comes after will have to cite Zaborowska. And I dare say that no one will be able to capture this story as well as she has. &#34;James Baldwin&#39;s Turkish Decade&#34; will change the field of Baldwin studies.&#34;--E.

Native people live in relation to all non-Natives amid the ongoing power relations of settler colonialism, despite never losing inherent claims to sovereignty as indigenous peoples. Explaining how relational distinctions of &#x201c;Native&#x201d; and &#x201c;settler&#x201d; define the status of being &#x201c;queer,&#x201d; <i>Spaces between Us </i>argues that modern queer subjects emerged among Natives and non-Natives by engaging the meaningful difference indigeneity makes within a settler society.</p><p>Morgensen&#x2019;s analysis exposes white settler colonialism as a primary condition for the development of modern queer politics in the United States. Bringing together historical and ethnographic cases, he shows how U.S. queer projects became non-Native and normatively white by comparatively examining the historical activism and critical theory of Native queer and Two-Spirit people.</p><p>Presenting a &#x201c;biopolitics of settler colonialism&#x201d;&#x2014;in which the imagined disappearance of indigeneity and sustained subjugation of all racialized peoples ensures a progressive future for white settlers&#x2014;<i>Spaces between Us</i> newly demonstrates the interdependence of nation, race, gender, and sexuality and offers opportunities for resistance in the United States. </p></p><p><p>Scott Lauria Morgensen is assistant professor of gender studies at Queen&#x2019;s University in Kingston, Ontario.

The essays show how Ranci�re's ideas can be used to analyse contemporary trends in both art and politics, including the events surrounding 9/11, war in the contemporary consensual age, and the ethical turn of aesthetics and politics. Ranci�re elaborates new directions for the concepts of politics and communism, as well as the notion of what a 'politics of art' might be. </p><p>This important collection includes several essays that have never previously been published in English, as well as a brand new afterword.

But his life in the Guardian Angels Orphanage is cruel and bleak, and when a stranger comes to claim Billy, he sets off on an extraordinary journey. From the coal mines of West Virginia to the world of a traveling circus, he searches for the secrets of his past, his future, and his own true self.</p></p><p><p>Tracey Porter is the author of <em>Treasures in the Dust</em> and <em>A Dance of Sisters</em>. Her most recent novel, <em>Billy Creekmore</em>, was named to Oprah.com's Kids' Reading List, compiled by the American Library Association. For the past twenty years she has taught middle school at Crossroads School in Santa Monica, California. She lives with her family in Los Angeles.</p>*Starred Review* Ten-year-old Billy's story begins in a Dickensian orphanage, where being pawned off to a local glass factory is one of the few routes out. Billy looks forward to working, until his pal runs away after being disfigured at the factory and discloses its real conditions. Billy is saved from the same fate by the appearance of a long-lost uncle, who takes him to a West Virginia coal mining town; soon the lad is going down in the mines himself. Then a mine caves in, and Billy's involvement with the union forces him to leave town--and join the circus. All of this might have become simply a string of eye-raising events if it wasn't for Porter's shrewd choice to frame this as a picaresque journey, similar in style, and in some ways substance, to that taken by Huck Finn. Porter's writing is strong, and the story, told in Billy's steadfast yet child-true voice, makes the shocking history about the lives of children at the turn of the last century come alive for today's readers. But this is no polemic; Billy's personal relationships, and his sensitivity to both the living and the dead, make this child very real as he searches for home. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In addition, she learns about the Elementals, people with power over fire, water, earth, and air, knowledge that makes her dangerous and marks her for possible death. This novel features an interesting story line and a strong heroine with realistic reactions to difficult situations. The writing is accessible, and the plot offers a new take on the supernatural genre, despite a logic flaw regarding why Elementals with power over one element are considered dangerous, while others, with even greater powers, are valued. Because of the romantic relationships, this debut novel invites possible comparisons with Twilight. It has great appeal to readers of supernatural fiction, as well anyone looking for a fast-paced story, realistic and relatable female protagonists, and serious issues that show up, surprisingly, in the last couple of chapters. It contains scenes involving underage drinking and sexual violence, making it most appropriate for older teens.-Natasha Forrester, Multnomah County Library, OR&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Catholics claim that Peter was the first bishop of Rome, and Eastern Orthodox Christians assert that he was the first bishop of Antioch. But does either position reflect the apostolic or episcopal offices completely or correctly? What, really was the role of bishops, and what was their relationship with apostles in the early Christian church? It is hard to imagine anyone better than Hugh Nibley to shed light on this challenging and intriguing topic</p><p>Hugh Nibley received his Ph.D. in history from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1939, and was emeritus professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University. A prolific writer, a keen and witty observer, and a relentless critic of the worldly, he has led members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of all ages to a deeper understanding of and commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Dr. Nibley passed away in February, 2005.</p><h2>Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key (Joey Pigza Books)</h2><p><p><b>"They say I'm wired bad, or wired sad, but there's no doubt about it -- I'm wired."</b></p><p>Joey Pigza's got heart, he's got a mom who loves him, and he's got "dud meds," which is what he calls the Ritalin pills that are supposed to even out his wild mood swings. Sometimes Joey makes bad choices. He learns the hard way that he shouldn't stick his finger in the pencil sharpener, or swallow his house key, or run with scissors. Joey ends up bouncing around a lot - and eventually he bounces himself all the way downown, into the district special-ed program, which could be the end of the line. As Joey knows, if he keeps making bad choices, he could just fall between the cracks for good. But he is determined not to let that happen.</p><p>In this antic yet poignant new novel, Jack Gantos has perfect pitch in capturing the humor, the off-the-wall intensity, and the serious challenges that life presents to a kid dealing with hyper-activity and related disorders. This title has Common Core connections.</p><p><i>Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key</i> is a 1998 National Book Award Finalist for Young People's Literature.</p></p><p>Joey Pigza has problems. Big problems. He was emotionally abused by his grandmother. He has never met his dad. He can't get along in his elementary school classroom because of his mood swings and his "dud meds." We gradually see that Joey must have Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), which is not being effectively controlled with his current medication. Joey's life is a terrifying roller-coaster ride, and Jack Gantos, author of the Rotten Ralph books, drags the reader along to see what life is like with ADD. The story is written from the boy's point of view in a sharp, worried style that veers out of control when Joey does. Joey's control of his own behavior slips away as we read, horrified to see this boy trying to get a grip on his life and failing. He disrupts the class field trip; he puts his finger in a pencil sharpener and injures himself; he swallows his house key. Then he runs through the classroom holding open sharp scissors. When he trips and falls, seriously injuring a classmate, he is transferred to a special-education program in another school. Here, thankfully, he encounters a caring teacher who recommends further medical evaluation, and Joey is eventually able to return to his former school. There is hope for Joey on the last page--he sits in the Big Quiet Chair to read. Gantos has achieved an unusual feat with this book. We want to turn away from Joey's shifting prison of emotions. But for those who stick with him, he shows us what his life is like. We walk a mile in his shoes, our feet hurting all the way. For young readers touched by ADD--and for their teachers and parents--Joey gives us the key to his world.

When he falls in love with a French woman, he learns that freedom and democracy do not apply to black soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Victor Daly wrote <i>Not Only War</i> in the midst of a major shift in America&#x2019;s racial dynamics.

He saw combat in France and was decorated for his service there.</p><p></p><p>After the war, when racial violence in America escalated, Daly and many other returning soldiers fought for civil rights. During the Harlem Renaissance, African Americans used literature to make the case for equality.

The two great conflicts in the book are the physical combat of war and the psychological combat of racism.</p><p>In addition to the original content of <i>Not Only War,</i> this paperback reprint includes three short stories and a previously published interview, as well as an introduction by David A.

Renowned clinician and scientist Dr. Pamela Peeke goes beyond diet and exercise with a lifestyle program that shows women how to stop being diet "POWs" ("Prisoners Of Weight") or victims of "Toxic Stress" and how to evolve into physically and mentally stress-resilient individuals. Peeke helps women identify their stress-eating profiles (Are you a stress-overeater? A stress-undereater?) and explains that to remove weight, you have to lift weight. She explains what to eat and, equally as important, when to eat by navigating the afternoon "CortiZone," the hours of highest vulnerability to stress eating. Learn how to put it all together through the fine art of regrouping.<br><br>Women can tailor this accessible program to their individual needs using Peeke's three behavior templates:<br><br>* Stress-resilient nutrition<br>* Stress-resilient physical activity<br>* Stress-resilient regrouping<br><br>Dr. Peeke's program is a must for women who want to break the stress-fat cycle that has thickened their after-forty waistlines.</p><p>If you're a woman over 40, you are undergoing physical and emotional changes, declining metabolism, fat deposits at your waistline, decreased energy, mood swings, food cravings--do we need to continue this list? Now pile on chronic, long-term stress (which the author terms <i>toxic stress</i>), which hits women between 40 and 60 and leads to self-destructive eating behavior. "Uncontrolled or toxic stress keeps the refueling appetite on, thus inducing stress eating and weight gain," Peeke explains. The stress triggers are constant, so the body never gets to turn off the stress response. The weight gained from this chronic, toxic stress--<i>toxic weight</i>--settles inside the abdomen and is associated with heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.<p> Peeke explains the association between stress and fat gain, and describes the stress/eating cycle ("the itch you can't scratch"). Then she teaches tools for "regrouping": formulating and following a contingency plan of nutrition, exercise, and self-care. Next are suggestions for a nutritional plan tied to stressful times of the day and an explanation of food needs after age 40. In the final chapters, Peeke nudges us to exercise to relieve stress, reduce body fat, and benefit overall health. Peeke is a highly regarded scientist and clinician who studies the link between stress and fat at the National Institutes of Health.

From the 1969 first moon landing to the amazing rescue of Apollo 13, each chapter tells the story of a different mission. Humorous details bring the astronauts to life: discover how the astronauts of Apollo 12&nbsp;were so over-excited when they stepped onto the Moon that Mission Control had to tell them to quieten down, and Shepard (Apollo 14) somehow managed to smuggle a golf club onto his spacecraft!&nbsp;Published to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, this is the perfect title for any child who has ever looked up at the moon and wondered what it might be like to go there.&nbsp;</p><p><p><b>David Long</b> writes for adults and children and specializes in history.

A. Maxwell Whyte</b> (1908&#x2013;1988) embarked on a journey in ministry that was fraught with uncertainty and an absence of familiar landmarks when he was sovereignly led by the Holy Spirit into an understanding of demonic activity and spiritual warfare. As is often the case with pioneers, he was misunderstood, ridiculed, and ostracized by the Christian community, even in his own city of Toronto. Despite great opposition, he forged ahead in the battle against the forces of Satan, convinced that the ministry of deliverance was scripturally based and was being restored to the church in his day. Later, he began to record his experiences, and over the next two and a half decades, he authored eighteen books. His first book, <i>The Power of the Blood</i>, has been translated into several languages and is widely distributed throughout the world, selling over half a million copies internationally.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Witchcraft in the Southwest: Spanish and Indian Supernaturalism on the Rio Grande</h2><p>&#34;Occasionally a truly remarkable book appears-one that takes a topic in need of discussion, thoroughly researches it, and presents credible results in a fascinating and extremely well manner. Witchcraft in the Southwest is such a volume, and as such, is a must for all readers, be they scholars, students, or others. . . . The volume devotes equal time to Spanish and Indian supernaturalism along the Rio Grande. Opening with a succinct review of the meaning and evolution of witchcraft in Europe and Spain, Simmons establishes the existence of many similar beliefs among native inhabitants of the New World. Moving chronologically to Spanish colonization, the author vividly conveys Spanish reactions to Pueblo life and religion, the fears of witches and other supernatural forces that plagued Spanish colonists. . . . Emphasizing the beliefs and nature of witchcraft rather than the actual mechanics (which are secret), he follows Hispanic communities into the late 19th century. . . . Readers learn how witchcraft fits into the Pueblo world view and how it compares and contrasts with European and Spanish varieties in such areas as motivation, types, powers, beliefs and means of acquisition. . . . Simmons&#39; study provides a needed overview and one that is carefully based on available ethnohistorical documents and credible anthropological data.&#34;-American Indian Quarterly A professional historian, author, editor, and translator, Marc Simmons has published numerous books and monographs on the Southwest as well as articles in more than twenty scholarly and popular journals.</p><p>A professional historian, author, editor, and translator, Marc Simmons has published numerous&nbsp;books and monographs on the Southwest as well as articles in more than twenty scholarly and popular journals.</p><h2>Memories of Muhammad: Why the Prophet Matters</h2><p><p> Who <i>was</i> Muhammad?

Its story, although full of crushed hopes and legal frustrations, is imbued with a sense of accomplishment. At another level, individual Mexican Americans who have attended segregated public schools over the years also have a complex and diverse story to tell. For some, there are fond memories of school activities gone by. For others, the school years have been negative in general_children have been victims of humiliating and depressing incidents of racial discrimination and social ostracism.<br><br> Texas' public school system is of particular historical interest because of the state's record, according to Guadalupe San Miguel, for providing the least amount of public education for Mexican Americans while fiercely defending its record of inferior and separate schooling. Additionally, Texas was the first state in which Mexican Americans organized to seek educational equality. <br><br> In "Let All of Them Take Heed," first published in 1987 and one of the earliest books to focus on this plight of the Hispanic community, San Miguel traces the Mexican American quest for educational equality in Texas over a period of fifty years. In describing this struggle over the years, he emphasizes the socioeconomic factors affecting it and the strategies the Hispanic community used to reach its goals. <br><br></p><p>GUADALUPE SAN MIGUEL, JR., who holds a Ph.D. from Stanford University, is a professor of history at the University of Houston.&#x201c;Since its release, Guadalupe San Miguel&#x2019;s <i>Let All of Them Take Heed</i> has remained the classic on the history of Texas-Mexican efforts to achieve educational parity.

It was adopted by the British Army in 1895 and only replaced by the L1A1 SLR in 1957; even then a sniper variant, the L42A1, was used until 1989, giving a service life of nearly a century. It saw combat from the Boer War onwards, and thousands are still in use today, notably by the Taliban in Afghanistan; it is estimated that 17 million have been produced. </p><p>The Lee-Enfield featured an innovative detachable ten-round magazine; this large capacity, together with the weapon's revolutionary bolt-action operation, made it possible for well-drilled shooters to fire 20 to 30 rounds in 60 seconds (the 'mad minute'). This extraordinary speed gave rise to mistaken German reports of being opposed by massed machine guns in 1914. The Short Magazine Lee-Enfield (SMLE), introduced in 1903, set a new precedent in military rifles, being neither a carbine nor a full-length rifle but an ingenious compromise that was soon copied by other countries.</p><p>The Lee-Enfield equipped British, Commonwealth and other forces throughout the world wars and well into the 1960s, giving excellent service in every kind of terrain and weather. Soldier's recollections of the rifle are overwhelmingly affectionate (it was known as the Smellie); today it remains a very popular target rifle for competitive shooting, and modern copies are being manufactured to meet demand.</p><p>Featuring first-hand accounts, brand-new full-colour artwork and close-up photographs, many in colour, this is the story of the Lee-Enfield, the innovative, reliable and long-lived rifle that equipped British and other forces through the world wars and beyond.</p></p><p>Martin Pegler has a BA Hons in Medieval and Modern History and an MA in Museum Studies, both from University College, London, and was for many years the Senior Curator of Firearms at the Royal Armouries Museum, Leeds.

Or did the company, the Coast Guard and the American Bureau of Shipping all have a hand on the helm of the SS El Faro as she steered too close to Hurricane Joaquin? This is an examination of a tragedy that has been well-researched and investigated &#x2014; heroically so at times &#x2014; by the United States Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board. Three very well-done books have been published. All of these efforts produced detailed recommendations and observations and all are publicly available. I commend them to you. My effort touches on the broad sweep and events of the tragedy and investigation, but if you want the detailed story of the final voyage of the ship, you&#x2019;re better off with the other books. My main goal here is to show how the SS El Faro fit into a larger system and culture &#x2014; one that I have been covering off and on as a journalist and author for 38 years. It&#x2019;s this system, I feel, that will result in another SS El Faro someday unless it is reformed. Another note on style. My preference in non-fiction is &#x201c;narrative.&#x201d; In other words, whenever I can, I tell a story and show what is happening; I prefer that to &#x201c;telling&#x201d; the reader, because I think &#x201c;showing&#x201d; is more readily absorbed. Humans learn through stories. Story telling rather than a lecture better illustrates the emotions at play here, as well as the moods, culture and vibe of the ship and the industry. This does not mean I take a pure poetic license. The dialogue quoted here is real, not made up. The material is factual.</p><p></p><h2>Abba&#39;s Abba Gold (Thirty Three and a Third series)</h2><p><p>Perhaps more than any other Greatest Hits compilation, <i>Abba Gold</i> has come to define a band's career on one disk. More than that, its release in 1992 heralded the critical rehabilitation of a group which had, since its demise a decade earlier, become little more than a memory of trashy costumes and cheesy tunes to many people. Here, Elisabeth Vincentelli charts the circumstances surrounding the birth of <i>Abba Gold</i>, looks at the impact it had on the music world, and tells the stories behind some of the greatest pop songs ever recorded.</p></p><p>Pop is the opium of the masses, the sweetener that makes you swallow the status quo-and that comforting attitude is reflected in pop&#39;s reliance on tried-and-true song structure, including the obligation to build up to a memorable chorus. The chorus is what sells the song, it&#39;s the part that&#39;s supposed to become imprinted in your head as it caps a sweet, sweet momentum. Starting a song with the chorus is the equivalent of drawing your gun too early in a shoot-out, of revealing your hand too hastily in a poker game: Once you&#39;ve given everything you have, where&#39;s the pay off? And yet &#34;Dancing Queen&#34; doesn&#39;t flag after its flamboyant beginning: The chorus acts as both teaser and pay off. Ironically for a band that was supposed to be a bunch of control freaks with a solution to every technical or musical conundrum, it later surfaced that &#34;Dancing Queen&#34; starts with the chorus because Abba just couldn&#39;t figure out how to make it work any other way.<p>Elisabeth Vincentelli is music editor of Time Out New York. She has also written for the Village Voice, Rolling Stone, and Entertainment Weekly among many other publications. She grew up in France and has loved Abba since watching them triumph at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974.</p></p><h2>The First Book of Mezzo-Soprano/Alto Solos - Part II</h2><p>(Vocal Collection).

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Werner Sombart (1863 -1941) was a German economist and sociologist and one of the leading Continental European social scientists during the first quarter of the 20th century. Sombart&#39;s &#34;The Jews and Modern Capitalism&#34; is an effort similar to Max Weber&#39;s historic study of the connection between Protestantism (especially Calvinism) and Capitalism, with Sombart documenting Jewish involvement in historic capitalist development. He argued that Jewish traders and manufacturers, excluded from the guilds, developed a distinctive antipathy to the fundamentals of medieval commerce, which they considered primitive and unprogressive. They tended to reject the medieval desire for &#39;just&#39; (and fixed) wages and prices, a system in which shares of the market were agreed upon and unchanging, profits and livelihoods modest but guaranteed, and limits placed on production. Excluded from the system, Sombart argued, the Jews broke it up and replaced it with modern capitalism, in which competition was unlimited and new rules or order were established. Paul Johnson, who considers the work &#34;a remarkable book&#34;, notes that Sombart left out some inconvenient truths, and ignored the powerful mystical elements of Judaism. Sombart refused to recognize, as Weber did, that wherever these religious systems, including Judaism, were at their most powerful and authoritarian, commerce did not flourish.

In <i>Incarnations</i>, Sunil Khilnani fills that space, bringing to life fifty extraordinary men and women who changed both India and the world. Journeying across India in pursuit of their stories&#x2015;visiting slum temples, ayurvedic call centers, Bollywood studios, textile mills, and Mughal fortresses&#x2015;Khilnani offers trenchant portraits of emperors, warriors, philosophers, artists, iconoclasts, and entrepreneurs. Some of these historical figures are famous. Some are unjustly forgotten. And all, Khilnani convinces us, are deeply relevant today. As their rich and surprising lives take the reader through twenty-five hundred winding years of Indian and world history, Khilnani brings wit, feeling, historical rigor, and uncommon insight to dilemmas that extend from ancient times to our own.</p><p>We encounter the Buddha not as the usual beatific icon but as a radical young social critic. We meet the ancient Sanskrit linguist who inspires computer programmers today. We hear the medieval poets, ribald and profound, who mocked rituals and caste and whose voices resonate in contemporary poetry. And we see giants of the twentieth-century Independence movement&#x2015;among them Mohandas Gandhi; Ambedkar, the Untouchable lawyer turned constitution maker; and the legendary singer M. S. Subbulakshmi&#x2015;not as cardboard cutouts but as complex and striving human beings. At once a provocative and sophisticated reinterpretation of India&#x2019;s history and an incisive commentary on its present-day conflicts and struggles, <i>Incarnations</i> is an authoritative, sweeping, and often moving account of a nation coming into its own.</p></p><p><b>Sunil Khilnani</b> is the author of the acclaimed and influential <i>The Idea of India</i> (FSG, 1998). Formerly the Starr Foundation Professor and Director of the South Asia Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C., he is currently the Avantha Professor and Director of the India Institute at King's College London. He is married to the writer Katherine Boo.<p>"A whirlwind tour of roughly 2,500 years of Indian history in 50 fast-paced chapters. . . . Khilnani's writing is easy to read, yet authoritative. He has spent much of his career studying-India . . . [and] strives to connect the lives and ideas of his subjects to one another and to contemporary India . . . Readers can dip in and out of chapters randomly without being confused, but <i>Incarnations</i> is most rewarding when read from start to finish . . . To my mind the best thing Khilnani has done is to leave the reader wanting more." <b>&#x2015;Vikas Bajaj, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>"An incisive work of popular history . . . undercutting, irreverent, and impish. It attempts to show, through prodigious but lightly worn scholarship, how complex and heterodox the Indian past was, and how it has been, and continues to be, constructed . . . Khilnani offers a fresh, cosmopolitan way of examining the Indian past. Everywhere he looks he sees rivers of influence and thought and ideas." <b>&#x2015;</b><b>Karan Mahajan, <i>The New Yorker</i></b></p><p>"Beautifully written with both scholarship and an enviably light touch, thoughtfully constructed and enviably erudite in its wide-ranging references, and as much at ease discussing higher mathematics and philosophy as politics and art, <i>Incarnations</i> is a major work by one of India&#x2019;s most impressive minds, and the best possible introduction to both the complexities and the charms of Indian history." <b>&#x2015;</b><b>William Dalrymple, <i>The Guardian</i> </b></p><p>"Incisive and elegantly written . . . A work of distinction." <b>&#x2015;John Keay, <i>The Times Literary Supplement </i></b><br><b></b><br>"Revelatory, bold and contemplative . . . Scholarly and accessible, lively and deeply serious . . . Is this simply cashing in on the idea behind the blockbuster <i>A History of the World in 100 Objects</i> by Neil MacGregor? Can anyone ever match the erudition and verve of the erstwhile director of the British Museum? Yes and yes. And though this may be heretical, at times Khilnani may even have surpassed him." <b>&#x2015;</b><b><i>The Independent</i></b></p><p>"A tour de force of intellectual history, engagingly written." <b>&#x2015;<i>Financial Times</i></b></p><p>"Khilnani is a rare blend of scholar and cracking travel writer . . . This exceptional book serves as a further reminder of India's great strengths." <b>&#x2015;<i>Sunday Times</i> (UK)</b></p><p>"Khilnani builds a mosaic of India's history since the time of the Buddha . . . [and] shows how the past has been remade to serve present-day agendas . . . [<i>Incarnations </i>is] punchy, personal, and quick moving, creating an incentive to learn more." <b>&#x2015;Andrew J. Nathan, <i>Foreign Affairs</i></b><br><b></b><br><b></b>"It is hard to think of this mammoth task being executed any better. Even those who know Indian history well will be introduced to figures they did not know<b>&#x2015;</b>and discover new things about familiar figures." <b>&#x2015;<i>The Telegraph </i></b></p><p>"Fuelled by a quiet, relentless curiosity and an extraordinary ability to capture the sweep of history. <i>Incarnations </i>is an essential, and timely, read . . . It is also an exceptionally liberating intellectual journey to take. Mr. Khilnani's prose is light and fast-paced . . . the solid labour of travel, research and meetings with other scholars as well as interviewees builds a stronger foundation for <i>Incarnations </i>than most non-fiction books about India can claim. And a more entertaining one than most, too." <b>&#x2015;</b><b><i>Business Standard </i></b></p><p>"This is a terrific book. Each biography runs into 10-13 pages, and though the prose is deceptively easy, you probably want to take your time as you savour the book, perhaps reading a piece daily. Or even reading and rereading it in this fashion for a long time to come. I know I will be placing a copy with each of my children so that they may know, in these anxiety-inducing times, what it truly means to be Indian." <b>&#x2015;<i>Mint </i>(India)</b></p><p>"Khilnani&#x2019;s choices are spirited, relevant, and aimed to provoke 'pressing contemporary questions' . . . immensely readable." <b>&#x2015;</b><i><b>Kirkus Reviews</b></i></p><p>"An idiosyncratic and lively journey across 2,500 years of Indian history, offering bite-size essays on the lives of 50 exemplary figures whose achievements and afterlives have influenced contemporary Indian identity . . . Khilnani&#x2019;s essays are provocative and serious, a worthy rebuttal to the image of Indian history as 'curiously unpeopled.'" <b>&#x2015;</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly </i></b></p><p>"How does one capture the multifaceted complexities of a country like India? Historian Khilnani presents a novel approach: weave a tapestry of 50 figures from the country&#x2019;s rich and ancient history that serves not only as an innovative introduction to the world&#x2019;s largest democracy but also a gauge to evaluate how that past informs the present . . . The well-researched yet short chapters cover a lot of ground with ease, and Khilnani succeeds in achieving his goal of emphasizing the continued relevance of history." <b>&#x2015;Poornima Apte, <i>Booklist </i></b></p></p><h2>Shopping Mall (Object Lessons)</h2><p><p>Object Lessons is a series of short, beautifully designed books about the hidden lives of ordinary things.</p><p>The mall near Mat thew Newton's childhood home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was one of the state's first enclosed shopping malls. Like all malls in their heyday, this one was a climate-controlled pleasuredome where strangers converged. It boasted waterfalls, fish ponds, an indoor ice skating rink larger than Rockefeller Center's, and a monolithic clock tower illuminated year-round beneath a canopy of interconnected skylights. It also became the backdrop for filmmaker George A. Romero's zombie opus <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>. </p><p>Part memoir and part case study, <i>Shopping Mall</i> examines the modern mythology of the mall and shows that, more than a collection of stores, it is a place of curiosity, ritual, and fantasy.</p><p>Object Lessons is published in partnership with an essay series in <i>The Atlantic.</i></p></p><p><b>Matthew Newton</b> is Associate Editor at Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His work has been published by the <i>Oxford American</i>, the <i>Atlantic</i>'s CityLab, <i>Forbes</i>, the <i>Rumpus</i>, <i>Guernica</i>, and <i>Spin</i>.<p>&#x201c;A smart and empathetic look at this waning icon of 20th-century American consumer culture.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Pittsburgh City Paper</i></p><p>"Matthew Newton evokes the American mall as symbol of white flight, aspirational fantasy, and shop-till-you-drop consumerism of the late 1980s. These are striking tales of suburban isolation in which Newton reveals life from the employee side of the counter to the idealistic architects' designs. Above all, he takes an aging mainstream phenomenon and makes it personal and present." &#x2015; <i>Yona Harvey, author of Hemming the Water</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>&#x201c;The best passages are those about the actual idea of the mall, designed by figures such as the Viennese Victor Gruen as a new sort of civic space that could replace the lost town square in a post-WWII America reshaped by the rise of suburbia. Newton wraps up with evocative reflections on instances of violence in shopping malls and questions about a possible renewal for these spaces, the popularity of which has flagged since their heyday nearly 30 years ago. To put it into the vernacular, this book about the mall is at its best when it&#x2019;s, like, totally about the mall.&#x201d; -<i> Publishers Weekly </i><br><i></i><br><i></i>&#x201c;<i>Shopping Mall </i>is for anyone who enjoys intelligent, thoughtful writing. It is surprisingly emotional for a book nominally about an impersonal space. It&#x2019;s safe to say this is the very best book I have ever read about a mall.&#x201d; - <i>Pittsburgh Magazine</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>&#x201c;This series really gets better and better. Newton linking his own life to the malls he knew growing up, and telling not only his story, but the fall of a very American institution, is engaging and profound." - Jason Diamond, author of<i> Searching for John Hughes </i><br><i></i><br><i></i>&#x201c;Newton explores the life of the shopping mall from the first ground-breaking, in the 1950s, through the chaos and excess of the 1980s to the present, including the death rattle of many malls ... In exploring a personal connection to the mall, he reveals a good bit about himself. The memoir elements of the book are eloquent and intimate, detailing his struggles with depression and anxiety. They also provide a reader with a walking bridge, an avenue for connection to the mall itself.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Pittsburgh City Paper</i><br><i></i><br>&#x201c;Newton succeeds in parsing out the different histories of the mall, from both personal and societal perspectives ... The mall, like so many other taken-for-granted parts of the built environment, holds memory and nostalgia for millions of suburbanites and shoppers. By leaving a trail of bittersweet crumbs of nostalgia, Newton spares the reader from the doom that others have cast over this cultural change. Rather than focusing on a dystopia of self-absorbed individuals doing their shopping and finding entertainment online, we are able to warmly recall the shopping mall and the lifeways in which it played a central roll [sic], not only for consumption but also for construction of self and community.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>PopMatters</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Shopping Mall</i> is both history of and paean to the once-ubiquitous American shopping centers. Essayist Matthew Newton combines his fond memories of his local mall, outside Pittsburgh, with anecdotes about the first one built in the United States, the Mall of America and others, using the specific to pull out the larger story of late-20th-century suburban commercialism that these edifices represent ... He isn't interested in defending shopping malls, but in showing how his--and many other people's--lives would be entirely different without them.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Shelf Awareness</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>&#x201c;Matthew Newton lets you know by Page 10 that he was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder as a teenager. These days, he&#x2019;s a productive and well-adjusted married man and dad, doing great work at the Carnegie Museum of Art, and his skills as an inquisitive writer and thinker are evident from his latest work. But knowing that part of his makeup helps the reader accept his obsessive compulsion with shopping malls &#x2015; particularly Monroeville Mall, the Valhalla of his childhood &#x2015; and appreciate the insights that spill forth in this brief cultural study/memoir ... Newton is the person to write this book because &#x201c;the shopping mall, more than any other place, electrified my imagination&#x201d; as a kid. His readers are beneficiaries of his experience seeing the mall &#x201c;as a sacred place of curiosity and wonder.&#x201d; - <i>Pittsburgh Quarterly</i></p></p><h2>Dawn</h2><p>In the exciting second Warriors story arc, the wild cats of the forest have lived in peace and harmony for many moons--but new prophecies from their warrior ancestors speak of a mysterious destiny and grave danger for the clans.

Strongly inflected by her longstanding involvement with philosophy and yoga, her pioneering investigations into the political, social, psychological and spiritual potential of conceptual art have had an incalculable influence on artists working today.</p><p>Published in conjunction with the most comprehensive exhibition of her work to date, this catalog presents more than 280 artworks that encompass the full range of Piper&#x2019;s mediums: works on paper, video, multimedia installation, performance, painting, sound and photo-texts. Essays by curators and scholars examine her extensive research into altered states of consciousness; the introduction of the Mythic Being&#x2015;her subversive masculine alter-ego; her media and installation works from after 1980, which reveal and challenge stereotypes of race and gender; and the global conditions that illuminate the significance of her art. Previously unpublished texts by the artist lay out significant events in her personal history and her deeply felt ideas about the relationship between viewer and art object.

Downs, author of <i>After Appomattox</i></b></p><p>Shiloh, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg&#x2015;tens of thousands of soldiers died on these iconic Civil War battlefields, and throughout the South civilians suffered terrible cruelty. At least three-quarters of a million lives were lost during the American Civil War. Given its seemingly indiscriminate mass destruction, this conflict is often thought of as the first &#x201c;total war.&#x201d; But Aaron Sheehan-Dean argues for another interpretation.</p><p><i>The Calculus of Violence</i> demonstrates that this notoriously bloody war could have been much worse. Military forces on both sides sought to contain casualties inflicted on soldiers and civilians. In Congress, in church pews, and in letters home, Americans debated the conditions under which lethal violence was legitimate, and their arguments differentiated carefully among victims&#x2015;women and men, black and white, enslaved and free. Sometimes, as Sheehan-Dean shows, these well-meaning restraints led to more carnage by implicitly justifying the killing of people who were not protected by the laws of war. As the Civil War raged on, the Union&#x2019;s confrontations with guerrillas and the Confederacy&#x2019;s confrontations with black soldiers forced a new reckoning with traditional categories of lawful combatants and raised legal disputes that still hang over military operations around the world today.</p><p>In examining the agonizing debates about the meaning of a just war in the Civil War era, Sheehan-Dean discards conventional abstractions&#x2015;total, soft, limited&#x2015;as too tidy to contain what actually happened on the ground.</p></p><p>Aaron Sheehan-Dean is Fred C.

He is currently editing the <i>Cambridge History of the American Civil War</i>.&#x201c;Assessing the potential for the escalation of violence in the course of the war, Sheehan-Dean concludes that at many junctures both North and South &#x2018;chose restraint&#x2019;; he rejects the widespread argument that the conflict evolved from limited to total war...

The first is a unique consideration&#x2015;from the point of view of Eastern Christianity&#x2015;of the Holy Grail, the chalice used by Joseph of Arimathea to catch the blood and water as it flowed from Jesus' side when it was pierced on the Cross by the spear of Longinus. This moment is described in John 19:34. Bulgakov's essay is a "dogmatic exegesis" of this passage in which, with astounding passion and precision, he reveals that the Earth itself and hence the human universe is the Grail wherein Christ lives forever. <br><br> The second essay is also unique&#x2015;the most important contribution to eucharistic theology by an Orthodox theologian. In the West, the meaning of the Communion bread and wine as the Christ's Body and Blood has been interpreted largely in philosophical terms deriving from Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Bulgakov insists on a christological and Gospel-based interpretation, one with tremendous significance for our understanding of the supernatural and sophianic nature of a world interpenetrated by the divine. <br><br> This little book is a priceless gift, enriching our understanding of the Christian mystery and two of its deepest aspects, the Grail and the Eucharist.</p><p><b>Sergei Bulgakov</b> (1879-1944) is considered by some to be the greatest Russian Orthodox theologian of the twentieth century. Early in the century, he progressed from Marxism through idealism to an acceptance of the Christian faith, becoming a Russian Orthodox priest in 1918. He was one of the most active figures in the Russian religious renaissance. During the 1920s, following in the footsteps of Vladimir Solovyov and Pavel Florensky, be began to develop a profound and original vision of Sophia. He was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1922 and moved to Paris, where he began the most fruitful period of his life. By the mid-1930s, his work had won enough disfavor with the Church hierarchy that he was censured and barred from teaching and performing priestly duties. Nevertheless, at his funeral he was eulogized as a "Christian sage, a teacher of the Church in the purest and most lofty sense ... enlightened by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Wisdom, the Spirit of Understanding, the Comforter," to whom he'd devoted his life.

Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions.&#39; (Text, Chapter 18). &#39;By declaring the phenomenal universe to be the work of the illusory ego, though not inherently evil or sinful, the Course gently resolves the great Platonic paradox of living in an imperfect, visible, and material world, yet knowing of a spiritual world whose Source is perfect and good.&#39; (From the Preface) This book is an in-depth exploration of the non-dualistic metaphysics of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; and its integration with living in this fundamentally illusory world. It discusses how the Course resolves the God-world paradox that has existed in the Western world since the time of Plato namely, how an imperfect material universe could result from a perfect immaterial Creator. Thus, the context of this exploration is the Platonic and Gnostic themes that have run through Western intellectual and religious history, and the similarities and contrasts between these and the Course. Love Does Not Condemn is in three parts: the first part introduces the Gnostics, Platonists, and the Church-Gnostic conflict of the first two centuries A.D.; the second discusses a seven-stage myth, as understood by Platonism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and A Course in Miracles; the third compares and contrasts the four approaches in light of the God-world paradox, and concludes with a discussion of the errors common to the Gnostics and many students of the Course. The appendix includes the complete text of the important Gnostic document &#34;The Gospel of Truth,&#34; glossary of terms, table of dates, bibliography, subject and name index, and an index of Course references.</p><p>Kenneth Wapnick, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist and one of the foremost teachers of A Course in Miracles, which he has been working with since 1973, when he joined Dr. Helen Schucman, scribe of the Course, and Dr. William Thetford at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. He has written more than 25 books on the Course, including Love Does Not Condemn, Absence from Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; The Message of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; and many others. He has also produced over 150 audio and video titles discussing the principles of the Course. He is President and co-founder, with his wife Gloria, of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles in Temecula, California.From the Preface: <p>A litany from the seventeenth-century Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England contains this petition: "From fornication, and all other deadly sin; and from all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil, Good Lord, deliver us"..."The world, the flesh, and the devil" have been preoccupations of world religions ever since people began reflecting on their existential situation of feeling alone and vulnerable in a world that could be perceived as harmful, evil, and uncaring. Religions, thus, can be seen as attempts to render sensible this otherwise inexplicable and meaningless phenomenal world. They have sought answers to the question of how a separated and physical world, apparently under the benevolent guidance of a loving and non-physical God, can arise in the first place, and then continually manifest pain and suffering. They address the problem of how one is to live in a world of the body, while trying to recall and identify with one's spiritual Self. </p><p>In the Western philosophical world, this problem has been addressed since the time of the pre-Socratics in ancient Greece, with Plato being the first to develop an elaborate cosmogony (study of the origin of the world) and cosmology (study of the nature of the world), and then an ethical system and theory of society that was derived from this. His work became the foundation for over two thousand years of theoretical speculation about the nature of spiritual reality and its relation to the world of the body, not to mention having presented a problem that has perplexed Platonists for centuries and centuries.... </p><p>It is my contention that concurrent with the rise and spread of Christianity ran a strong thread of truth, closer to the message of the living Jesus and counter to the orthodox Christian position. The roots of this thread in the Western world are traceable back to Plato and before, and extend through the great Gnostic and Neoplatonic thinkers to the present day, where A Course in Miracles is among its clearest and purest exponents. This thread reflects a unified spirit, despite its disparate voices. It is the spirit of a wisdom that recognizes the alienation of living in a world that does not correspond to the pure oneness of God, the voice of one experiencing the paradox of the un-bridgeable gulf between the perfection of God and His creation, set against the obvious imperfections of this world that are so foreign to one's true Self. And yet it is a voice that sees salvation from this world as possible if not inevitable. </p><p>In many ways, therefore, A Course in Miracles can be seen as integrating the Platonic, Christian, and Gnostic traditions, while at the same time correcting and extending them through a far more inclusive vision that utilizes the insights of contemporary psychology to support its universal message of salvation. My earlier book, Forgiveness and Jesus: The Meeting Place of A Course in Miracles and Christianity, dealt with many of the similarities and differences between Christianity and the Course. The current book explores this comparison in greater depth, more specifically focusing on the behavioral implications of the respective positions of these and the Gnostic and Platonic thought systems regarding the origin and nature of the body and the phenomenal world; in other words, how to meet the challenge stated in John's gospel of being in the world yet not of it.... </p><p>Our point of departure is the conviction that A Course in Miracles represents the highest level of contemporary spiritual thought and, even more specifically, of Christian thought. The Course alone, of all the explanations that present the meaning and message of Jesus' life, presents a theology -- both abstractly and practically -- that is without contradiction. This book's principal argument, to be developed in the succeeding chapters, is that a theology or philosophy that begins with the premise that this phenomenal world is in any way the manifestation of the Will of God, must inevitably fall into the paradoxical trap of placing within the omni-benevolent God an inherent flaw that contains the tendency towards evil, suffering, and death or, at least, a Will that allows it to happen, the traditional Christian theological position.... </p><p>One of the basic premises of this book is that A Course in Miracles, although not bridging this unbridgeable gap, has nonetheless successfully resolved the paradox of the One and the many, eternity and time, without the inherent inconsistencies in attitude, if not theory, that have plagued all Platonists, and have marred the history of Judaism and Christianity from their inception. The Course accomplishes this by presenting its thought system on two basic levels. The first of these is metaphysical, contrasting the spiritual reality of Heaven with the illusory, phenomenal world of the ego. The second, remaining only within this world, contrasts two ways of interpreting what is perceived: the ego's condemnatory judgment of sin vs. the Holy Spirit's vision of a forgiving classroom in which we learn to see all thoughts and actions as either expressing love or calling for it. Thus, the material world is seen as illusory but not evil, serving the Holy Spirit's purpose of correcting our purpose in having made it. As is stated in the following passage from the text, which provided this book with its title: The body was not made by love. Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions (T-18.VI.4:8). By declaring the phenomenal universe to be the work of the illusory ego, though not inherently evil or sinful, the Course gently resolves the great Platonic paradox of living in an imperfect, visible, and material world, yet knowing of a spiritual world whose Source is perfect and good.</p></p><h2>Chinese Slanguage: A Fun Visual Guide to Mandarin Terms and Phrases (English and Chinese Edition)</h2><p><p>It&#x2019;s simple: follow the illustrated prompts and read the English words out loud, and soon you&#x2019;ll be speaking Chinese.

The book concerns the Mennonites, who move from Prussia to the Crimea where, by copying and improving the agricultural methods of their Turkish neighbors, they develop Turkey Red, a hardy strain of winter wheat. When the Mennonites move again, they take their wheat with them to the United States. In the most successful section of the book, Fleming highlights the role of the children in the move, as they sift through the grain to preserve the hardiest specimens for the relocation. The Mennonite arrival in Kansas began the winter wheat industry, which has been a foundation of that area's economy ever since. Although this historical episode is relatively minor, it is effectively used to illustrate such basic principles as the importance of hard work, religious freedom, and adapting and learning about the environment. The prose, however, is hardly distinguished, including as it does much invented dialogue. This description can also be applied to Himler's line drawings, which seem unusually stiff and unfinished.

This Leonardo da Vinci of our time - an incomparable designer, engineer, and architect - proved that a single individual, through sheer initiative, can have an astounding impact on the world. <p>As one of the first to perceive that humanity&#x2019;s very survival was dependent on global cooperation and making the necessities of life available to all, he devoted most of his life to that cause. He created modern technologies and revolutionary designs that would support humanity in working as one global community on what he referred to as &#x201c;Spaceship Earth.&#x201d; Fuller&#x2019;s was a bold, global perspective - one based on a new way of merging Nature and technology. With great enthusiasm, he extrapolated from the intricate structure of Nature to design imaginative, ultramodern inventions for the common good, among which the Geodesic Dome, the Dymaxion Car, the Dymaxion House, and the Dymaxion Map figure most prominently. </p><p>Lloyd Steven Sieden, a respected educator and consultant on Buckminster Fuller, remains true to the vitality and imagination of Fuller&#x2019;s ideas and wisdom. His book follows Fuller&#x2019;s life in order to translate his complex ideas into clear, accessible language. Sieden brings new light to Fuller&#x2019;s fascinating belief system and the rationale behind his futuristic designs; he also shows how these unprecedented designs model the framework of Fuller&#x2019;s elaborate philosophy. </p><p>This eloquent and inspiring work fulfills the need for a book that ultimately recognizes and articulates Fuller&#x2019;s monumental contributions to humanity. It conveys an appreciative portrayal of the man affectionately dubbed &#x201c;the grandfather of the Universe.&#x201d; It also vividly illustrates Fuller&#x2019;s enormous impact upon and contribution to society as well as the ways in which his visionary ideas will continue to shape and expand our perception of Spaceship Earth for years to come.</p><b>Lloyd Steven Sieden</b> is a lecturer, consultant, and educator with a specialty in the ideas of Buckminster Fuller.

Described by <em>Mother Jones</em> as &#x201c;the nation&#x2019;s best-known protest consultant,&#x201d; Fithian has supported countless movements including the Battle of Seattle in 1999, rebuilding and defending communities following Hurricane Katrina, Occupy Wall Street, and the uprisings at Standing Rock and in Ferguson. For anyone who wants to become more active in resistance or is just feeling overwhelmed or hopeless, <em>Shut It Down</em> offers strategies and actions you can take right now to promote justice and incite change in your own community.</p> <p>In <em>Shut It Down </em>Fithian shares historic, behind-the-scenes stories from some of the most important people-powered movements of the past several decades. She shows how movements that embrace direct action have always been, and continue to be, the most radical and rapid means for transforming the ills of our society. <em>Shut It Down </em>is filled with instructions and inspiration for how movements can evolve as the struggle for social justice continues in the Trump era and beyond.</p> <p>While recognizing that electoral politics, legislation, and policy are all important pathways to change, <em>Shut It Down</em> argues that civil disobedience is not just one of the only actions that remains when all else fails, but a spiritual pursuit that protects our deepest selves and allows us to reclaim our humanity. Change can come, but only if we&#x2019;re open to creatively, lovingly, and strategically standing up, sometimes at great risk to ourselves, to protect what we love.</p></p><p><p>Lisa Fithian is an anti-racist organizer who has worked for justice since the 1970s.

Lisa enjoys walking, playing with children, gardening, cooking&nbsp;great food, being in the wild, and raising up new generations to be agents of change. She is grateful to play her part in manifesting a world rooted in respect, justice, and liberation.</p><p>&#x201c;As the left gets serious about electoral organizing, it&#x2019;s more important than ever that our movements also stay mobilized, disobedient, and in the streets.

Now she learns that angels shun the Ystarans&#x2019; descendants. If they are touched by angelic magic, the descendants&#x2019; blood turns to ash. They are known as Refusers, and can only live the most lowly lives.</p><p>But Liliath cares nothing for the descendants of her people. Four young Sarancians hold her interest: Simeon, a studious doctor-in-training; Henri, a dedicated fortune hunter; Agnez, an adventurous musketeer cadet; and Dorotea, an icon-maker and scholar of angelic magic. </p><p>The four feel a strange kinship from the moment they meet, but do not know why, or suspect their importance. All become pawns in Liliath&#x2019;s grand scheme to fulfill her destiny and be united with the love of her life.

PBS called him ''One of the revolutionaries who made America,'' and <i>Inc.</i> magazine name him ''Edison's rightful heir.'' <br><br> Now Kurzweil has created a novel and an unforgettable character-Danielle-to help convey some of his most important ideas. <i>Danielle: Chronicles of a Superheroine</i>, tells the story of a precocious young girl who uses her intelligence and accelerating technology to solve humanity's grandest challenges. Now if only we can find more courageous visionaries like Danielle. <br><br> Written as an alternative history, Danielle's journey as a driven young girl brings her face to face with many important figures from recent history and our modern world. Told through the eyes of Danielle's equally remarkable sister Claire, a girl adopted from Haiti after surviving the earthquake, this story shows all readers a hopeful vision of humanity's future-and how to achieve it. <br><br> The novel features 24 graphic novel-style illustrations, one for each year of Danielle's life, by <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist and Ray's daughter, Amy Kurzweil (author of <i>Flying Couch: A Graphic Memoir</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Editor's Pick and Best of 2016). <br><br> Accompanying the novel are two nonfiction companion works by the author, which is a literary first. Included in this volume is <i>How You Can Be A Danielle</i>, a call to action, providing pragmatic, thought-provoking and clear guidance on how readers can be inspired to emulate Danielle and help bring about a better world. A separate volume, <i>A Chronicle of Ideas: A Guide for Superheroines (and Superheroes)</i> provides Kurzweil's-and Danielle's-unique spin on 282 concepts presented in the novel.Age Range: Teen</p><p>Ray Kurzweil is one of the world's leading inventors, thinkers, and futurists, with a thirty-year track record of accurate predictions. Called ''the restless genius'' by The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and ''the ultimate thinking machine'' by <i>Forbes</i> magazine, he was selected as one of the top entrepreneurs by <i>Inc.</i> magazine, which described him as the ''rightful heir to Thomas Edison.'' PBS selected him as one of the ''sixteen revolutionaries who made America.'' <br><br> Ray was the principal inventor of the first CCD flat-bed scanner, the first omni-font optical character recognition, the first print-to-speech reading machine for the blind, the first text-to-speech synthesizer, the first music synthesizer capable of recreating the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition. <br><br> Among Ray's many honors, he received a Grammy Award for outstanding achievements in music technology; he is the recipient of the <i>National Medal of Technology</i>, was inducted into the <i>National Inventors Hall of Fame</i>, holds twenty-one honorary Doctorates, and honors from three U.S. presidents. <br><br> Ray has written five national best-selling books, including <i>New York Times</i> best sellers <i>The Singularity Is Near</i> (2005) and <i>How To Create A Mind</i> (2012). He is Co-Founder and Chancellor of Singularity University and a Director of Engineering at Google heading up a team developing machine intelligence and natural language understanding.<p>"Danielle: Chronicles of a Superheroine is a coming-of-age novel that also serves as a call to action.<br><br>In American inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil's young adult coming-of-age epic Danielle: Chronicles of a Superheroine, capable children are given the freedom to innovate solutions to real world problems.<br><br>An American aid worker adopts Claire, a six-year-old Haitian girl who's left orphaned after an earthquake devastates her island. Her baby sister, Danielle, is born two years later. At first, she seems verbally and physically delayed, but she surprises her family when she's two with her advanced conversational and abstract thinking skills.<br><br>The girls' father is inspired to start the Stern School (inspired by the nineteenth century, progressive Stern Schule, founded by Kurzweil's great-grandmother) to foster his children's remarkable skills, with a nontraditional, interdisciplinary curriculum whose lessons can be applied in the field. Danielle's ideas evolve into policies that solve global economic, health, and political crises, turning her into an in-demand star.<br><br>The book follows a structure akin to the scientific method. Chapters are organized as year-by-year episodes from Danielle's childhood and adolescence. Those that cover her childhood are short, but chapters become longer in her adolescence when the conceptual problems she deals with become more complex.<br><br>Each chapter describes a pressing global concern that Danielle wishes to address. Danielle, as supervised by Claire, devises hypothetical solutions that she tests in the field and modifies her procedures as conflicts arise. She achieves varying degrees of success. This consistent structure, along with short, to-the-point sentences, keep the story's pace even. Well-placed dialogue between narrative paragraphs keeps the story moving forward with few breaks in its action.<br><br>Though it is written in a way that's accessible to young adults, the book's abstract concepts in quantum physics, advanced math, and economic theory are sometimes difficult to follow. The most challenging moments are limited to later chapters in the book.<br><br>Divided into two distinct parts, the book's first half reads like standard fiction, while it's second half acts as a companion to the first, with suggestions for becoming a self-made superhero and facilitating action. Amy Kurzweil's graphic novel illustrations help to break the story up into digestible chunks.<br><br>Claire and Danielle function as personifications of Kurzweil's economic, political, and scientific leanings, and Claire's story runs second to the accomplishments of her sister. Her role is supporting: she is Danielle's caretaker, conscience, and adviser. Danielle herself is compulsive and precocious, and so it's Claire's voice that grounds the story. Their Stern School classmates are conduits for explanations of the sisters' actions.<br><br>Danielle and Claire's alternative view of history can't help but end on a high note, given the "superhero" nature of Danielle's gifts and the ebullient optimism that follows each of their respective successes. The final takeaway is that there is no harm in trying something new; doing so might yield insights into and help to solve important issues.<br><br>An allegory about encouraging teenage inventiveness, Danielle: Chronicles of a Superheroine is a coming-of-age novel that also serves as a call to action."<br>--<strong>Foreword Clarion Review</strong><br><br>"Danielle is a modern-day hero for everyone to look up to.

Farewell My Concubine</em> was translated by Andrea Lingenfelter, a scholar and translator affiliated with the University of Washington in Seattle. </p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p>Prostitutes have no heart; actors have no morals. So people say. A prostitute has to make her living by putting on a show of feeling in bed; an actor may be the embodiment of virtue and integrity as he struts upon the stage. He may be an emperor, a statesman, or a great general. The stage is populated by brilliant young scholars and beautiful ladies whose exalted passions are more vivid than the drab colors of our workaday existence. Compared to their stories, everyday life is like the plain and pale face of an actor stripped of his makeup. </p><p>Without a stage to prop him up, the actor is just an ordinary man, with an unmemorable face and unfulfilled expectations. His strength and power come from artifice-he relies on them to live, just as an embryo draws nourishment from the body of the mother, and the growing child holds fast to her hand. In the same way, women have long depended on men to sustain them. In exchange they reveal a part of the elusive secret that is their charm. But how much of that is just stagecraft? </p><p>After all, life is just a play. Or an opera. It would be easier for all of us if we could watch only the highlights. Instead, we must endure convoluted plot twists and excruciating moments of suspense. We sit in the dark, threatened by vague menaces. Of course, those of us in the audience can always walk out; but the players have no choice. Once the curtain goes up they have to perform the play from beginning to end. They have nowhere to hide.</p><br> <p>But we are still in the theater, watching the opera being performed for us onstage. Both of the actors are in full makeup, and we see two brightly colored faces. One belongs to the actor playing the beautiful concubine Yuji. Opposite him is the actor who plays General Xiang Yu, Yu Ji's lover. Yuji's entire existence depends on Xiang Yu. And he has lost his kingdom to a rival. </p><p>Yu Ji is singing an aria to him: </p><p>"My lord is doomed,<br>I have nowhere to turn." </p><p>His life is over, and she will choose not to go on living.</p><p>But this is only an opera. The actors feign death, and the curtain falls. In the end they both stand up and walk away. </p><p>Actually, one actor really is in love with the other. Still, their story is not that simple. When one man loves another, it can't be simple; and it's hard to know how to begin. We might as well start at the beginning. </p><p>The theater is dark. As the houselights come up, the musicians enter and start to tune their instruments. The percussionist holds one hand ready to strike a leather drum while the other holds up clappers. He seems to be ready. The other musicians are still busy tuning. Everyone is filled with nervous excitement. Tonight they have a chance to participate in a moving drama. They will be part of someone else's story. </p><p>The fights dim again until there is nothing but a lone spotlight shining center stage. A faint creak, and the curtain parts. </p><p>It is their first meeting.</p><br> <p>Winter, 1929. The eighteenth year of the Republic of China Strong, icy winds blew out of the North. It was the darkest and coldest time of the year, when a feeble sun wavered in the sky. Some days it peeked out; but on this day it was hidden behind the clouds. People looked up at the sky, wondering if it might snow, although it was still early in the season. </p><p>It was market day at Tianqiao, the Bridge of Heaven, and the clamor of voices filled the air. The Bridge of Heaven lay between Zhengyang Gate and Yongding Gate, just to the west of the Temple of Heaven. During the Ming and Qing dynasties the emperor made yearly offerings at the temple, and he always crossed this bridge on the way. The temple lay on the south side of the bridge, and people imagined the emperor's crossing from the north side to the south symbolized a passage from the earthly realm to heaven. Because the emperor, or Son of Heaven, used this bridge to cross to heaven, it was called the Bridge of Heaven. But after the fan of the Qing dynasty, in 1911, the bridge became part of the common world. Never again would it be used solely by the Son of Heaven. </p><p>A small but bustling marketplace grew up on the north side of this bridge. Lining the north-south street were teahouses, small restaurants, and secondhand clothing stalls. To the west ran a bird market, facing a row of stands that sold snacks of every kind. In the midst of all this, street performers plied their trades among the shoppers. </p><p>Little urchins wove through the crowds where they were thickest. One of them spotted a cigarette butt on the ground and quickly bent down to grab it. When he had gathered up enough discarded butts, he would take them all apart and salvage the tobacco. Then he would roll new cigarettes to sell on the street. </p><p>He had to be alert and snatch up the butts before somebody stepped on them. This last butt had narrowly missed being crushed by two pairs of feet, a woman's and a child's. </p><p>The woman had almost tread on the urchin's fingers with her worn cloth shoes. Once crimson, those shoes ha d faded to the brown of an old bloodstain. The woman herself had the sallow complexion of an opium addict, and her lips were tinged with a bit of lipstick. A red hairline mark, running like a scar between her eyebrows, suggested that she suffered from frequent headaches and had been pinching her forehead to cure them. Any careful observer would have known that she was an unlicensed prostitute.</p></p><h2>Geraniums: The Complete Encyclopedia</h2><p>This beautiful and comprehensive volume on easy-to-grow geraniums (pelargoniums) provides a wealth of new information for hobby growers from all climates, including valuable tips on the challenges each region presents.

Climate change. Crumbling infrastructure. It&#x2019;s clear that in today&#x2019;s era of fiscal constraints and political gridlock, we can no longer turn to government alone to tackle these and other towering social problems. What&#x2019;s required is a new, more collaborative and productive economic system. <i>The Solution Revolution</i> brings hope revealing just such a burgeoning new economy where players from across the spectrum of business, government, philanthropy, and social enterprise converge to solve big problems and create public value.<br><br>By erasing public-private sector boundaries, the solution economy is unlocking trillions of dollars in social benefit and commercial value. Where tough societal problems persist, new problem solvers are crowdfunding, ridesharing, app-developing, or impact-investing to design innovative new solutions for seemingly intractable problems. Providing low-cost health care, fighting poverty, creating renewable energy, and preventing obesity are just a few of the tough challenges that also represent tremendous opportunities for those at the vanguard of this movement. They create markets for social good and trade solutions instead of dollars to fill the gap between what government can provide and what citizens need.<br><br>So what drives the solution economy? Who are these new players and how are their roles changing? How can we grow the movement? And how can we participate?<br><br>Deloitte&#x2019;s William D. Eggers and Paul Macmillan answer these questions and more, and they introduce us to the people and organizations driving the revolution from edgy social enterprises growing at a clip of 15 percent a year, to megafoundations, to <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies delivering social good on the path to profit. Recyclebank, RelayRides, and LivingGoods are just a few of the innovative organizations you&#x2019;ll read about in this book.<br><br>Government cannot handle alone the huge challenges facing our global society and it shouldn&#x2019;t.

Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher.

Consulting with personal trainers, coaches, and doctors at the US Olympic Center, he followed the rigorous training regimen of a world-class athlete.<br><br>Along the way, he learned to cope with his physical limitations and, when his father was diagnosed with a life-threatening brain tumor, discovered something about the real meaning of endurance.<br><br>Told with his trademark intelligence, humor, and honesty,&nbsp;<i>Long Distance</i>&nbsp;is an insightful examination of&nbsp;the culture and mind-set of endurance athletes, and a moving and inspiring meditation on finding balance in our often harried lives.</p><p>At the age of 37, bestselling author and journalist Bill McKibben stepped out of the ordinary routine of his life to spend a year in "real training" as a cross-country skier. With the help of a trainer-slash-guru, McKibben took on a regimen equivalent to that of an Olympic endurance athlete's, running and skiing for hours every day in preparation for a series of grueling long-distance ski races. What prompted this successful writer with an admitted aversion to competitive sports to push himself so hard, for so long? <blockquote>Partly it was pure selfishness; after a decade as an environmental writer and activist, I needed a break from failing to save the world. But mostly it was curiosity that drove me. By year's end I hoped I'd have more sense of what life lived through the body felt like.</blockquote> <p> If <i>Long Distance</i> begins as a story about the transformation of the body and what it means to challenge one's physical limits, it evolves into a thoughtful lesson about a wholly different kind of endurance. Halfway through McKibben's training, his father was diagnosed with the most virulent form of brain cancer. As McKibben was reaching peak condition, his father's life lurched toward an end, forcing McKibben to snap out of his self-inflicted self-absorption. He had tried to think of endurance as "the ability to fight through the drama of pain. But now I understood it, too, as a kind of elegance, a lightness that could only come from such deep comfort with yourself that you began to forget about yourself." And the elegance of <i>Long Distance</i> is in its ultimate lesson that each of us has a mind, a body, and a spirit, and we must find our strength in all three realms. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p><b>Bill McKibben</b>&nbsp;is the author of more than a dozen books, including&nbsp;<i>The End of Nature</i>,&nbsp;<i>Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Deep Economy</i>.

Founded by Empress Catherine the Great in 1764, the stunning Winter Palace was built to house her growing collection of Old Masters and to serve as a home for the imperial family.

Following some preliminary research at the Wharton County Junior College Library, he focused his search on the area between the San Bernard and West Bernard rivers. Within two weeks after beginning the search for artifacts, a Mexican army site was discovered, and, with the help of the Houston Archeological Society, excavated. Then began the archival exploration of the history behind the archeology, the contacting of historians with expertise in that period, and even the learning of Spanish so that the original source documents could be studied. The result is an amazing <i>tour de force</i> for a doctor who was &#x201c;adept at circumcisions, spinal taps, and treating asthma but . . . knew next to nothing about Texas history.&#x201d;<br><br>One of those consulted in the course of this work was noted historian Professor James E. Crisp of North Carolina State University, who calls the author a &#x201c;natural historian&#x201d; and describes Dimmick&#x2019;s findings as &#x201c;a story which rivals the miracle of San Jacinto in importance . . . a remarkably complete account of what happened to the main force of the Mexican army between April 21 and the second week of May, 1836 . . . a few days [within which] an orderly Mexican withdrawal to a defensive position within Texas turned into an unmitigated disaster which sealed the fate of the Mexican campaign.&#x201d;<br><br>The movements of the Mexican army during the two-week period from April 21 to May 9, 1836, are followed in meticulous detail, based on the full scope of published and unpublished sources, many of which appear here in English, and in their entirety, for the first time. The actions of Mexican generals Vicente Filisola and Jos� de Urrea and the bitter rivalry between them are presented in their own words, from their letters and diaries. And this is only half the story. The author and his &#x201c;digging buddies&#x201d; have located many actual artifacts dropped or discarded in the mud by Mexican soldados more than 165 years ago. Thousands of hours excavating in the Sea of Mud (<i>El Mar de </i><i>Lodo</i>) have produced hundreds of items (many pictured and described in the book) along with the army&#x2019;s trail&#x2014;munitions, arms, uniform fragments, and personal items&#x2014;all serving to paint a more accurate picture than we have heretofore had of Santa Anna&#x2019;s army and its response to his order to retreat.<br><br>All in all, this is a breathtaking accomplishment in historical and archeological investigation and a book that will henceforth be a standard reference for those studying the 1836 campaign in Texas.</p><p>GREGG J. DIMMICK is a pediatrician with the South Texas Medical Clinics in Wharton, Texas. He did his undergraduate work at Texas A&amp;M University and received his M.D. in 1977 from the University of Nebraska Medical School. He was born and raised in Wyoming. He has worked closely with the Houston Archeological Society in the research for this book and has coauthored two previous monographs, published by the Society, on the Mexican Army&#x2019;s retreat in the 1836 campaign.</p><h2>Classic Rock Instrumentals (Guitar Recorded Versions)</h2><p>(Guitar Recorded Versions).

Her poem &#x201c;Not Waving but Drowning&#x201d; has been widely anthologized,&nbsp;and her life was celebrated in the classic 1978 movie <em>Stevie</em>. This new and updated edition of Stevie Smith&#x2019;s collected poems includes hundreds of works from her thirty-five-year career. The Smith scholar Will May collects poems and illustrations from published volumes, provides fascinating details about their provenance, and describes the various versions Smith presented. Satirical, mischievous, teasing, disarming, Smith&#x2019;s poems take readers from comedy to tragedy and back again, while her line drawings are by turns unsettling and beguiling.</p><p><p><strong>Stevie Smith</strong> (1902-1971) was the author of three novels and nine poetry volumes and lived almost her whole life in northern London. She was officially recognized with the Cholmondeley Award for Poetry in 1966 and the Queen&#x2019;s Gold Medal for poetry in 1969.</p><p><strong>Will May</strong> is author of <em>Stevie Smith and Authorship</em> (Oxford University Press, 2010)</p>&#x201c;A landmark volume brimming with wit, surprises, sardonic pleasures, and abiding compassion.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Donna Seaman, <em>Booklist (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Now, forty-five years after her death, bound inside this large annotated collection, [Smith] can be celebrated as a major English poet of the twentieth century. She is a writer of astonishing skill, range, comedy, and depth of feeling; she is inimitable, strange, and utterly original.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Hermione Lee, <em>The New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;She is a great poet because almost half a century after her death, her poems are more startling and bizarre than those of many poets who deliberately set out, as one suspects Smith never did, to be startling and bizarre.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Orr, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A rare bird, a Maltese falcon. A more individual talent than Stevie Smith&#x2019;s you don&#x2019;t get.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Clive James, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;That sense of the uncanny, the&nbsp;<em>unheimlich</em>&nbsp;or the peculiar, the grip of childhood terrors, the chance&#x2015;perhaps our greatest fear&#x2015;of never being known, the intimacy of wickedness, they are all here, in these poems.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Cynthia Zarin, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Smith&#x2019;s great gift is to sit on our shoulder like a feisty bird that&#x2019;s traveled a long distance, has been half starved on the way, and hopes your map will be a different from hers.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Barbara Berman, <em>The Rumpus</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A poet who deserves a place, among her follow modernists, as one of the best, silly-serious, funny-sad, mock mock-heroic poets of our time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Angela Leighton, <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Those crazy about this wonderful and strange poet will obviously want Will May's splendid <em>All the Poems</em>&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Dirda, <em>The Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;There is variety and inventiveness, much humor and understanding and a constant poignancy. Her gift was to create a peculiar emotional weather between the words, a sense of pity for what is infringed and unfulfilled. Death, waste, loneliness, cruelty, the maimed, the stupid, the innocent, the trusting&#x2015;her concerns were central ones, her compassion genuine and her vision almost tragic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Seamus Heaney</strong><br><br>&#x201c;I am a desperate Stevie Smith addict.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sylvia Plath</strong></p><h2>Triassic-Jurassic of western Massachusetts: easily acessable geology field trips</h2><p>With many illustrations, John Hubert leads you on easily accessible field trips to Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rocks in the Connecticut Valley of western Massachusetts. John writes about the rocks in non-technical language, with geologic terms explained as introduced. The trips are a hands-on experience of the evidence allowing you to visualize now vanished mountains, rivers, playas, lakes, deltas, alluvial fans, and volcanic lavas, along with the dinosaurs that roamed the rift valley.</p><p></p><h2>Instructions for His Generals (Dover Military History, Weapons, Armor)</h2><p>The king of Prussia from 1740 to 1786, Frederick the Great ranks among eighteenth-century Europe's most enlightened rulers. In addition to abolishing serfdom in his domains and promoting religious tolerance, he was an ardent patron of the arts and an accomplished musician. "Diplomacy without arms," he observed, "is like music without instruments." Frederick's expertise at military matters is reflected in his successful defense of his territory during the Seven Years' War, in which he fought all the great powers of Europe. His brilliant theories on strategy, tactics, and discipline are all explained in this vital text.<br>"War is not an affair of chance," Frederick asserted, adding that "a great deal of knowledge, study, and meditation is necessary to conduct it well." In this book, he presents the fundamentals of warfare, discussing such timeless considerations as leadership qualities, the value of surprise, and ways to conquer an enemy who possesses superior forces. The soundness of his advice was endorsed by Napoleon himself, who once advised, "Read and re-read the campaigns of Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar . . . and Frederick. This is the only way to become a great captain and to master the secrets of the art of war."</p><p></p><h2>Drive-By Truckers&#x2019; Southern Rock Opera (33 1/3, 133)</h2><p><p>The Drive-By Truckers' <i>Southern Rock Opera</i> takes listeners on a road trip through the American South, with stops along mean old highways and soul-sucking swamps, iconic recording studios and doomed chartered jets, and even Heaven and Hell.

Edwin Mullins seeks out hidden traces of that ancient world along with the many spectacular monuments that today adorn the cities of Nimes, Arles, Vienne, and Orange. He tells the story of how the Romans came to invade Provence, how they stayed to colonize it, and how they transformed Provencal cities into imitations of Rome. His narrative also tells how the Emperor Constantine brought about the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity from his favorite city of Arles and how the Romans were eventually driven out by the Visigoths. Roman Provence is also a guide to the principal sites in the region as well as those rarely visited, with separate chapters on various Roman achievements: triumphal arches, aqueducts, farming, city life, bridges and road-building, temples and shrines, theaters and amphitheaters.</p><p>Edwin Mullins is a writer, journalist and film-maker.

O&#39;Brien</h2><p><p>This book tells the story of Michael O'Brien, one of the most popular Catholic novelists and painters of our times. It covers his life from his childhood in the Canadian Arctic to the crucial decision in 1976 to devote himself wholly to Christian sacred arts, followed by his inspiration to write fiction and his best-selling apocalyptic novel, <i>Father Elijah</i>. The story then continues to the present with explorations of O'Brien's other works.</p><p>O'Brien's life is one of struggle against all odds to reestablish Christian culture in the materialist void created by the modern Western world. It is a timely reminder of hope in trials and sufferings, of endurance during marginalization and poverty. This is the first biography of O'Brien, and it also provides an introduction to his novels, paintings, and essays.</p><p>The author, Clemens Cavallin, was granted unrestricted access to Michael O'Brien's personal archive, including his diary from the late 1970s until the present day.

Now many of those early stories and essays (most of which first appeared in <i>Guideposts</i>) are collected in one volume, organized around thirteen spiritual motifs. In <i>Firstlight</i>, Kidd charts her emergence as a writer and seeker; reflects on her roles as wife, mother, daughter, nurse, and artist; and assesses what she has learned in settings as far-flung as Africa and her own home. The result is an intimate, uplifting book, filled with moments of recognition and discovery.</p><p>SUE MONK KIDD is the author of the novels, <i>The Secret Life of Bees</i> and <i>The Mermaid Chair</i>, and the memoirs, <i>The Dance of the Dissident Daughter, When the Heart Waits</i>, and <i>Firstlight</i>, a collection of early writings. <i>The Secret Life of Bees</i> has spent more than 125 weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list and was adapted into an award-winning movie. <i>The Mermaid Chair</i>, a #1 New York Times bestseller, was adapted into a television movie. Each of her novels has been translated into more than 24 languages. The recipient of numerous literary awards, Sue lives in South Carolina with her husband.<p> </p>Long before THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES and THE MERMAID CHAIR became bestsellers, Sue Monk Kidd's inspirational writings were well known to readers of Norman Vincent Peale's interdenominational GUIDEPOST MAGAZINE. FIRSTLIGHT is a compilation of many of these early essays. Kidd's special gifts are her ability to identify the divine in everyday occurrences and to give the listener a road map for her own spiritual journey. Kate Forbes reads these essays with a confidence in her voice that adds credibility to the spiritual truths Kidd examines. Forbes's delivery is measured and concise, allowing listeners to reflect and experience epiphanies as they use Kidd's spiritual lens to see the divine in their lives.

Is it visible or invisible, one or many, local or universal, hierarchical or congregational in its structure, sacramental or biblical in its expression? Different Christians--whether Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, or Evangelical--tend to approach these foundational questions through the lenses of their own histories and traditions. Some place great weight on the Church's Christological foundations, and thus on history. Others place more emphasis on the dynamic work of the Spirit, with its capacity to introduce the new and the unexpected. Others see an original diversity of ecclesiologies, grounding a contemporary pluralism of confessions. These lenses color not just how Christians see the church today, but also how they imagine it for tomorrow.</p> <p>In <i>Towards a Truly Catholic Church</i>, Thomas Rausch, SJ, draws on these different voices to develop a theology for the church that builds on the work of the Vatican II, is ecumenical in its approach, and envisions the church in the context of globalization. In an increasingly interconnected world, Rausch offers hope that tomorrow's church will be a world church, a communion that reconciles unity in diversity.</p> <p>Chapters are<i>Lumen Gentium</i>, <i>Gaudium et Spes</i>, Metaphors and Models of Church, Communion in the Body of Christ, The Church's Apostolic Ministry, Safeguarding the Apostolic Tradition, The Marks of the Church, Reception and Communion, A Truly Catholic Church, Challenges to the Other Christian Churches, and Challenges to Roman Catholic Church.</p> <p><i>Thomas P.

Indeed, these pages--which garnered a flurry of attention among readers and in the media--constitute a passionate and persuasive testament to the value of political, social, and community reengagement. Drawing on a wide range of literary and cultural influences--from the writings of Montaigne and Thoreau to the recent popularity of empty entertainment and breathless chroniclers of the technological age--Purdy raises potent questions about our stewardship of civic values.<br><br>Most important, Purdy offers us an engaging, honest, and bracing reminder of what is crucial to the healing and betterment of society, and impels us to consider all that we hold in common.</p><p>Jedediah Purdy is only in his mid-20s, but there are times when, working your way through Purdy's precisely crafted sentences, you would swear that the author is an old man. The problem with the world today, Purdy says, is that too many of us have withdrawn from it. "Often it begins in ironic avoidance," he writes, "the studied refusal to trust or hope openly. Elsewhere it comes from reckless credulity, the embrace of a tissue of illusions bound together by untested hope." He urges a revitalization of the notion of public responsibility, "the active preservation of things that we must hold in common or, eventually, lose altogether." Purdy is well aware that politics, the most visible of the public arenas, is nowadays regarded as a training ground for opportunists and hypocrites. But he insists that if we invest our lives with a dignity rooted in "the harmony of commitment, knowledge, and work," even politics might be restored.<p> <i>For Common Things</i> is quick to make pronouncements along the lines of "Today's young people are adept with phrases that reduce personality to symptoms," without mentioning that it was their therapy-happy baby boomer parents who introduced words like <i>passive-aggressive</i> and <i>repressed</i> into their vocabulary--and without broaching the possibility that it was the combined failure of the '60s counterculture movement and the loss of faith in government attendant to the Watergate scandal that nurtured cynicism and ironic detachment within the boomers. (Well, perhaps solving the problem <i>is</i> more important than assigning the blame.) At times, the Harvard-educated author's erudition gets the best of him, and his prose takes on a certain academic stiffness. (One wonders, at such moments, if perhaps the book has its roots in a senior thesis.) But when Purdy focuses on personal matters related to his homeschooled West Virginia upbringing, one can detect traces of a passion and intensity that would be well worth developing in future writings. Which is not to say that Purdy doesn't feel strongly about the restoration of civic commitment; this book stands as proof that he does. But anybody can--and many people do--make impersonal assessments of the state of the world; there is a story, however, that only Jedediah Purdy can tell us about community and responsibility. The traces of that story in <i>For Common Things</i> may leave many readers clamoring for more details. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>"At fourteen, I entered public high school in West Virginia. My little band of homeschooling friends had disappeared, most gone from the state, and I was beginning to feel an adolescent's frustration at spending days with only my family on our farm. I spent three years at Calhoun County High School, none of them easy. I arrived knowing nothing of the subtle codes and taboos of teen culture, and came on that knowledge hard, in the rough-and-tumble of social jockeying. Academically, meanwhile, I was stagnant, teaching myself most of what I learned and losing the time when there was nothing to learn.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>At the end of three years, I was more easily a part of the place than I would have imagined when I began. However, I also sensed that there was no growth for me there, and that I should leave. I wrote away to the only private school I had heard of, Phillips Exeter in New Hampshire, and was offered a scholarship for my senior year. That year was in many ways a less radical transition than the move from home to public school had been. Although the elite culture of New England was novel and odd, I was for the first time in an institution where students and teachers alike respected intellectual seriousness, and where my excitement about a novel or a theory might be understood and shared. I worked hard and flourished.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>When that year ended, I went back to West Virginia. Four years of unbroken schooling seemed enough to me, and I wanted to do practical work as an adult before beginning college. I spent the summer working as a carpenter, and in the fall spent my savings in backpacking alone through Europe. In the winter, I returned again and took a job with the West Virginia Environmental Council, the state's only large environmental organization. I spent the next eight months at the state capitol, in the coalfields, at public meetings and in private homes across the state, working with community members in local environmental battles, with legislators in policy disputes, and always in an effort to bring the two together, to draw participants in local issues into a statewide network of political engagement. I came to know West Virginia better than I ever had before, partly because my work now required attention to the state as a whole, partly because I was for the first time there by decision rather than by happenstance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>During that year, I applied to Harvard, where I began in the fall of 1993. The next four years were extraordinary for their intellectual richness, and, as time went on, for the richness of their friendships as well. I studied the history of ideas and moral philosophy, worked in campus journalism and progressive politics, and completed a thesis on Michel de Montaigne. At the same time, in private essays and works for friends, I continued to explore the themes that would become For Common Things.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>On graduating, I began writing essays for the American Prospect, a magazine of progressive journalism and opinion. I spent much of the next year concentrating on that work and developing some of the themes that would come into <i>For Common Things</i>, including my encounter with Eastern Europe and my intial effort at describing the culture of irony.<p>At the end of that year, I entered school again, this time at Yale, to study law, property, and environmental and cultural values. I am particularly interested in the variety of ways that we can conceive of the natural world: as a simple source of resources or as something more<br>integrally and intrinsically valuable. I am also intensely interested in the history of conceptions of politics and citizenship, and especially of the idea that democracy is not just a structure of government but is related to deep ideas of human excellence and flourishing. However, these projects are only beginning, and I will have to report more on them later.</p><p><br><i>For Common Things</i> has been developing in me for at least six years. I have had intimations of it, in the way that anyone who writes does: hints that something is taking form, slowly adding layer upon layer until it is ready for expression.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The essential impulse of the book is to draw out the unity concealed in disparate things, places, styles, persons. It is an attempt to marry two forms that I have pursued by impulse since I began writing: the essay and the poem. Essays follow idea to idea, experience to experience, in a wild ride of association, the zig-zagging path that Emerson said revealed a pattern only when viewed from a proper distance. The essay is bold, a little reckless, uncertain of its ground until it stands or collapses at the end. Its ideal result is a map of a continent, or even the famous earth photograph.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A poem, by contrast, burrows as deeply as possible into a particular moment or location. It attends to every texture, every line and grain, every border of light and shadow. It looks until there is nothing more to see, and then closes its eyes and waits. Sometimes, then, a lesson comes; more often there is only the place, and the pleasure of keen attention. The poem produces, perhaps, a topographic map of a tiny watershed, or more likely a pen-and-ink sketch of a piece of hickory bark.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In this book I am trying to make sense of broad currents of culture and politics. This is an essay's ambition. However, it is an ambition that requires tempering by the honesty of the poem, which always refuses stereotype and polemic in order to see its object as it is, rather than as it would be convenient to the writer to have it be. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I think that this is necessary because the public faces of the culture today are defined by insistent flatness, a wary, ironic, skeptical stance toward all things, people, and pronouncements. I have been conducting a running argument with this attitude since I first met it, late in adolescence. Yet more and more it seems to me that to attack this attitude is only to reinforce it, to add debunking to debunking, an eye for an eye until every eye is jaded. Instead, what is required is a proposal that the ironic attitude is not true, that we do, and must, hope for, trust, and risk more than that attitude admits. Making this proposal means trying to describe our situation sensitvely and carefully enough to show that it contains these impulses toward, even these requirements of, hope. It means drawing contour and texture out of a relentlessly flat map, showing that our cultural topography is richer than we have recently acknowledged.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The purpose of that evocation is to make the case that, although we do not always admit it, we inhabit a world worthy of our love. This is a young man's hope, wagered against a time inclined to doubt. It is the reason for this book.</p><p><br><i>On homeschooling</i></p><p>My younger sister and I were homeschooled on our family's hillside farm in West Virginia. Until I turned fourteen and entered high school, we had no tests, scant lesson plans, and few assignments. Instead, we were free to read, to play, and to work alongside our parents. We made no distinction between the summer and the school year, marked by the appearance of yellow buses on the paved road that we could see when we walked a few hundred yards out our dirt driveway. Learning did not have its own season, room, or time of day. Learning was living with a child's curiosity, and there was no living without learning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>We constantly read, drew our adult acquaintances into long explanations of their work and ideas, and undertook projects of our own to test what we had seen and heard. If our learning had been rendered as a map, it would have resembled nothing so much as a topographic sketch of<br>many day-long rambles, in which each newly discovered ridge could drop me into five unexpected hollows, and the streams of those hollows led me to broader valleys, and then back to other ridges, so that a picture of a place grew out of years of small, cumulative explorations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I have always believed since that homeschooling's great gift is the belief that living and learning are inseparable. Not all the homeschoolers I knew became star students, although some did. However, every one of them discovered some native talent or inclination early in life, and wove years of education around it. One played piano for five hours each d-ay, another disassembled and rebuilt gasoline engines, a third designed shortwave radios, still another learned the history of the Civil War at a level that college students would envy--all at an age when most students are moving by rote through the multiplication tables. We homeschoolers learned arithmetic too, but by way of these personal projects, these explorations that we wanted to undertake above anything else in the world. Because we learned through these, learning was itself what we wanted above all else.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>When children's education becomes an obligation rather than a pleasure, something has gone wrong. Young people are by nature explorers of an endlessly fascinating world, and the work of education should be to preserve that spirit. Homeschooling aims at this preservation, and often succeeds.

The only previous Bacon catalogue raisonn� was published in 1964, gathering only 37% of Bacon&#x2019;s ultimate oeuvre, and featuring only 27 color reproductions. Only about half of the 584 paintings that survive are accessible to the public in exhibitions and publications; with <em>Francis Bacon: Catalogue Raisonn�</em>, the painter&#x2019;s entire oeuvre can be seen and assessed for the first time.</p><p>The catalogue, containing around 800 illustrations across five clothbound, hardcover volumes, includes three books comprising the study of Bacon&#x2019;s entire working history, which are bookended by two further volumes: the first including an introduction, chronology and an indispensible index and users&#x2019; guide, and the second a catalogue of Bacon&#x2019;s sketches with an illustrated bibliography. Beautifully produced and printed, the five volumes of <em>Francis Bacon: Catalogue Raisonn�</em> are boxed within a handsome cloth slipcase.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;<strong>Francis Bacon</strong> (1909&#x2013;92) is widely regarded as Britain&#x2019;s greatest modern painter. Drawing on low-art sources, including photographs torn from magazines and imagery from films, coupled with a keen awareness of the rich historical tradition of painting stretching back to the Renaissance, Bacon developed a way of portraying the human body which was unique. His mastery of the medium of paint was recognized early. By 1946, the critic Kenneth Clark felt able to state simply: &#x2018;Francis Bacon has genius&#x2019;.&#x201d; �&#x2013;&#x2013;<em>Francis Bacon</em> (Tate Publishing, 2008)&nbsp;</p><p>Since 1970, <strong>Martin Harrison</strong> has published on 19�th and 20�th century art and photography and curated exhibitions in the UK (Victoria &amp; Albert Museum; National Portrait Gallery; Ashmolean Museum), Italy, the USA and Mexico. He co-curated the Bacon exhibition at the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Dusseldorf in 2006, and <em>Francis Bacon / Henry Moore: Flesh and Bone</em>, The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 2013.

And it&#x2019;s not easy<br>for an 8-year-old to say &#x201c;beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>Another egg was opened to reveal a rock.

Like<br>the majority of people on the busy avenue, I would<br>hardly have noticed him standing there. But the very thing on my mind<br>was the very reason he was there, so I stopped.<br><br>I&#x2019;d just spent a portion of the morning preparing a lesson out of the<br>ninth chapter of John, the chapter that contains the story about the man<br>blind from birth. I&#x2019;d finished lunch and was returning to my office when<br>I saw him. He was singing. An aluminum cane was in his left hand; his<br>right hand was extended and open, awaiting donations. He was blind.<br><br>After walking past him about five steps, I stopped and mumbled<br>something to myself about the epitome of hypocrisy and went back in his<br>direction. I put some change in his hand. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said and then<br>offered me a common Brazilian translation, &#x201c;and may you have health.&#x201d;<br>Ironic wish.<br><br>Once again I started on my way. Once again the morning&#x2019;s study of<br>John 9 stopped me. &#x201c;Jesus saw a man, blind from birth.&#x201d; I paused and<br>pondered. If Jesus were here he would see this man. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what<br>that meant. But I was sure I hadn&#x2019;t done it. So I turned around again.<br><br>As if the giving of a donation entitled me to do so, I stopped beside a<br>nearby car and observed. I challenged myself to see him. I would stay here<br>until I saw more than a sightless indigent on a busy thoroughfare in<br>downtown Rio de Janeiro.<br><br>I watched him sing. Some beggars grovel in a corner cultivating pity.<br>Others unashamedly lay their children on blankets in the middle of the<br>sidewalk thinking that only the hardest of hearts would ignore a dirty,<br>naked infant asking for bread.<br><br>But this man did none of that. He stood. He stood tall. And he sang.<br>Loudly. Even proudly. All of us had more reason to sing than he, but he<br>was the one singing. Mainly, he sang folk songs. Once I thought he was<br>singing a hymn, though I wasn&#x2019;t sure.<br><br>His husky voice was out of place amid the buzz of commerce. Like a<br>sparrow who found his way into a noisy factory, or a lost fawn on an interstate,<br>his singing conjured up an awkward marriage between progress and<br>simplicity.<br><br>The passersby had various reactions. Some were curious and gazed<br>unabashedly. Others were uncomfortable. They were quick to duck their<br>heads or walk in a wider circle. &#x201c;No reminders of harshness today, please.&#x201d;<br>Most, however, hardly noticed him. Their thoughts were occupied, their<br>agendas were full and he was...well, he was a blind beggar.<br><br>I was thankful he couldn&#x2019;t see the way they looked at him.<br><br>After a few minutes, I went up to him again. &#x201c;Have you had any<br>lunch?&#x201d; I asked. He stopped singing. He turned his head toward the<br>sound of my voice and directed his face somewhere past my ear. His eye<br>sockets were empty. He said he was hungry. I went to a nearby restaurant<br>and bought him a sandwich and something cold to drink.<br><br>When I came back he was still singing and his hands were still empty.<br>He was grateful for the food. We sat down on a nearby bench. Between<br>bites he told me about himself. Twenty-eight years old. Single. Living with<br>his parents and seven brothers. &#x201c;Were you born blind?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, when I was young I had an accident.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t volunteer any<br>details and I didn&#x2019;t have the gall to request them.<br><br>Though we were almost the same age, we were light-years apart. My<br>three decades had been a summer vacation of family excursions, Sunday<br>school, debate teams, football, and a search for the Mighty One. Growing<br>up blind in the Third World surely offered none of these. My daily concern<br>now involved people, thoughts, concepts, and communication. His<br>day was stitched with concerns of survival: coins, handouts, and food. I&#x2019;d<br>go home to a nice apartment, a hot meal, and a good wife. I hated to think<br>of the home he would encounter. I&#x2019;d seen enough overcrowded huts on<br>the hills of Rio to make a reasonable guess. And his reception...would<br>there be anyone there to make him feel special when he got home?<br><br>I came whisker-close to asking him, &#x201c;Does it make you mad that I&#x2019;m<br>not you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Do you ever lie awake at night wondering why the hand you<br>were dealt was so different from the one given a million or so others born<br>thirty years ago?&#x201d;<br><br>I wore a shirt and tie and some new shoes. His shoes had holes and his<br>coat was oversized and bulky. His pants gaped open from a rip in the knee.<br><br>And still he sang. Though a sightless, penniless hobo, he still found<br>a song and sang it courageously. (I wondered which room in his heart that<br>song came from.)<br><br>At worst, I figured, he sang from desperation. His song was all he had.<br>Even when no one gave any coins, he still had his song. Yet he seemed too<br>peaceful to be singing out of self-preservation.<br><br>Or perhaps he sang from ignorance. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t know what he<br>had never had.<br><br>No, I decided the motivation that fit his demeanor was the one you&#x2019;d<br>least expect. He was singing from contentment. Somehow this eyeless<br>pauper had discovered a candle called satisfaction and it glowed in his<br>dark world. Someone had told him, or maybe he&#x2019;d told himself, that<br>tomorrow&#x2019;s joy is fathered by today&#x2019;s acceptance. Acceptance of what, at<br>least for the moment, you cannot alter.<br><br>I looked up at the Niagara of faces that flowed past us. Grim.<br>Professional. Some determined. Some disguised. But none were singing,<br>not even silently. What if each face were a billboard that announced the<br>true state of the owner&#x2019;s heart? How many would say &#x201c;Desperate! Business<br>on the rocks!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Broken: In Need of Repair,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Faithless, Frantic, and<br>Fearful&#x201d;? Quite a few.<br><br>The irony was painfully amusing. This blind man could be the most<br>peaceful fellow on the street. No diploma, no awards, and no future&#x2014;at<br>least in the aggressive sense of the word. But I wondered how many in that<br>urban stampede would trade their boardrooms and blue suits in a second<br>for a chance to drink at this young man&#x2019;s well.<br><br>&#x201c;Faith is the bird that sings while it is yet dark.&#x201d;<br><br>Before I helped my friend back to his position, I tried to verbalize my<br>empathy. &#x201c;Life is hard, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; A slight smile. He again turned his face<br>toward the direction of my voice and started to respond, then paused and<br>said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get back to work.&#x201d;<br><br>For almost a block, I could hear him singing. And in my mind&#x2019;s eye I<br>could still see him. But the man I now saw was a different one than the<br>one to whom I&#x2019;d given a few coins. Though the man I now saw was still<br>sightless, he was remarkably insightful. And though I was the one with<br>eyes, it was he who gave me a new vision.</p><h2>Alaia</h2><p><b>A special twentieth anniversary edition of the only definitive publication on one of the most respected and influential fashion designers of our time.</b><br><br>A new edition of the only major monograph published on Ala�a, which has been out of print for over a decade.

Despite being behind bars, inmates can find numerous opportunities to exploit situations for their own advantage. Whether for some kind of gain or just for fun, the manipulative games inmates play can cause serious disruptions in the orderly operation of an institution. Well-meaning employees can find themselves in compromising positions, and talented professionals can have their careers ruined by being unwittingly manipulated by sly inmates. Game Over! Strategies for Redirecting Inmate Deception helps correctional staff and volunteers recognize and respond to these con games by delving into the nature of inmate deception and manipulation. Drs. Elliott and Verdeyen discuss the aspects inherent in prison life that encourage inmates to lie and deceive. In addition, they explain how manipulation as a way of life is a reflection of the exploitative view that inmates have of others. By understanding the purpose and the perceived benefits of deceptive behavior, and by recognizing the situations that are most likely to allow such behavior to occur, correctional employees are in a better position to spot a set up or con and respond appropriately without being deceived. Learning to identify inmate deception does more than protect the employees. It also provides positive treatment for the inmates. When inmates get away with deceiving staff, they do not gain anything. They merely continue the unhealthy behavior patterns that got them in trouble in the first place. By detecting and stopping their con games, correctional staff show inmates honesty and integrity in action, modeling pro-social skills that the inmates would do well to emulate.</p><p></p><h2>Complete Atlas of the World, 4th Edition: Classic Mapping for the Modern World (DK Reference Atlases)</h2><p><b>Filled with beautiful maps showing our dynamic world in stunning detail, this comprehensive atlas is the perfect choice for anyone interested in the geography of our planet.</b><br><br>First published in 2007 and now in its 4th edition, the <i>Complete Atlas of the World</i> has been fully revised and updated to encompass recent world events.<br><br>The opening section of the book provides a fascinating insight into our planet from a number of perspectives, ranging from oceans to population and economics.

In language accessible to the lay reader, Haught first looks at the many ways in which religion has manifested itself by considering what he perceives as the four key elements of all religions: sacramentalism, mysticism, silence, and activism. He then discusses the value of religion and also considers the aims of religion, which he sees as reassurance, mystery, adventure, and morality, and the various challenges to religion: secularism, skepticism, and nihilism. Haught is familiar enough with all the major traditions so that he is able to make cogent comparisons, offering a good deal of basic information.<br><i>-Augustine J.

Cohen does an excellent job of presenting the origins of Talmudic literature and summarizing in a meaningful way the many doctrines it contains.</p><p>The Talmud is among the great books of wisdom--like the Bible, the Quran, and the Bhagavad Gita--whose citation gives a speaker instant credibility. Also like the Bible, the Quran, and the Bhagavad Gita, the Talmud is a powerful source of allusion in large part even though so few people have really read it. People don't read the Talmud because they think it's inaccessible--the sprawling collection of rabbinic writings is added to in each generation, and its significance is nothing less than the summary of Judaism. The best guide to the Talmud's labyrinthine form is Abraham Cohen's <i>Everyman's Talmud: The Major Teachings of the Rabbinic Sages</i>--a monumental work of scholarly summary that describes all the basic doctrines of Judaism. <i>Everyman's Talmud</i> includes concise chapters on everything from sin to superstitions to a Jew's duty to animals. You probably won't be able to read it straight through--doctrine, even elegantly distilled, is hard to take in big doses--but you'll be led back to it again and again, by questions that arise in daily life, at dinner parties, and from the pages of the daily newspaper. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"To some readers of this book, the Talmud represents little more than a famous Jewish book. But people want to know about a book that, they are told, defines Judaism. "Everyman's Talmud is the right place to begin not only to learn about Judaism in general but to meet the substance of the Talmud in particular. . . . In time to come, Cohen's book will find its companion-though I do not anticipate it will ever require a successor for what it accomplishes with elegance and intelligence: a systematic theology of the Talmud's Judaism."<br>--From the Foreword by Jacob Neusner <br>Long regarded as the classic introduction to the teachings of the Talmud, this comprehensive and masterly distillation summarizes the wisdom of the rabbinic sages on the dominant themes of Judaism: the doctrine of God; God and the universe; the soul and its destiny; prophesy and revelation; physical life; moral life and social living; law, ethics, and jurisprudence; legends and folk traditions; the Messiah and the world to come.</p><h2>West Dickens Avenue: A Marine at Khe Sanh</h2><p>In January 1968, John Corbett and his fellow leathernecks of the 26th Marine Regiment fortified a remote outpost at a place in South Vietnam called Khe Sanh. Within days of their arrival, twenty thousand North Vietnamese soldiers surrounded the base. What followed over the next seventy-seven days became one of the deadliest fights of the Vietnam War&#x2014;and one of the greatest battles in military history.<br><br>Private First Class Corbett made do with little or no sleep for days on end. The enemy bombarded the base incessantly. Extremes of heat, cold, and fog added to the misery, as did all manner of wounds and injuries too minor to justify evacuation from frontline positions. The emotional toll was tremendous as the Marines saw their friends suffer and die every day of the siege. Corbett relates these experiences through the eyes of a twenty-year-old but with the mind and maturity of a man now in his fifties. His story of life, death, and growing up on the front lines at Khe Sanh speaks for all of the Marines caught up in <i>the</i> epic siege of the Vietnam War.</p><p><b>John Corbett </b>returned home to Nyack, New York, following his service in Vietnam. He now lives in Key Largo, Florida. <i>West Dickens Avenue</i> is his first book.1: Enlistment<br> &nbsp;<br> Nyack, New York, July 1967<br> &nbsp;<br> I left school during my first year of college. I romanticized about joining the French foreign legion, knowing I didn&#x2019;t even need to speak French. All I had to do was sign a five-year contract and they would teach me French. My youthful dreams of riding a camel across desert sand dunes, wearing a white kepi hat on my head, had faded. &#x201c;Greetings,&#x201d; said Uncle Sam&#x2019;s draft notice that arrived in the mail. The United States wanted me for military service and undoubtedly would send me to Vietnam. I ripped up the draft notice in front of my mother and father at the dinner table. My act didn&#x2019;t go over well with my law-abiding, conservative, Irish-Catholic parents.<br> &nbsp;<br> I decided to go to Canada and be a draft dodger. Canada is much closer than Corsica, where the foreign legion was. I wanted some adventure, but not the adventure my government wanted to provide, such as sending me to Vietnam.<br> &nbsp;<br> I hadn&#x2019;t thought much about America&#x2019;s involvement in Vietnam. World affairs were just that, a world away, in my mind. I was rebellious and determined not to let Uncle Sam tell me what to do. I could dream about traversing sand dunes with the French foreign legion but not about being a drafted government-issue GI Joe.<br> &nbsp;<br> I prepared to leave for Canada; I was going to Montreal. Even my high school French books were packed.<br> &nbsp;<br> O&#x2019;Donoghue&#x2019;s Tavern, 66 Main Street, Nyack, New York<br> &nbsp;<br> The tavern was on lower Main Street, where the street slopes and terminates on the west shore of the Hudson River. The river is almost at its widest point here. The city of Tarrytown can be seen on the opposite shore, three miles across the river, night or day, except when fog enshrouds this section of the river valley. Nyack, my hometown, is twenty-five miles north of New York City. The river is not as clean as it was when Henry Hudson first discovered and explored it, sailing in his ship the Half Moon, but the river&#x2019;s towering majestic palisades haven&#x2019;t changed since Henry was here.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sipping a beer, I glanced around at familiar surroundings. I wondered if I would ever see this place again. I wondered how I would do in Canada.<br> &nbsp;<br> While pondering my future as a draft dodger, I saw a familiar face coming through the doorway of O&#x2019;Donoghue&#x2019;s. The man walked with a limp that I didn&#x2019;t recall his having before. It was Tom Dunnigan, an old school chum. The last time I saw him, more than a year ago, he was leaving for Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps boot camp.<br> &nbsp;<br> We had some beers together. He told me he had just been released from a naval hospital after months of convalescing from wounds suffered in Vietnam. His right side was partially paralyzed and he walked with a cane. He had a steel plate in his skull to close a hole inflicted by shrapnel. He was wounded in Vietnam by an enemy mortar shell. He had joined the Marines and was trained, shipped to Vietnam, and wounded, all within a year. Just months ago the parishioners at our local Catholic Church, Saint Ann&#x2019;s, where Tom and I were once altar boys, held a prayer service for him, because he wasn&#x2019;t expected to survive his wounds.<br> &nbsp;<br> We had attended the same schools, played ball, fished, and gotten into mischief as we grew up. Conversation flowed easily that night. Over the beers I listened to his stories, one by one, about ambushes, about hills whose names were numbers on a military map, and about villages and provinces with funny-sounding names. He told me about Vietnamese people I didn&#x2019;t know. He said the Vietnamese had odd-sounding terms for their money: dong and piasters. I watched his eyes as he related his stories.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tom&#x2019;s beers had gotten to him and he was all storied out. I was glad, because I was tired of listening to his Vietnam and Marine stories. I was ready to go home. Thoughts of Canada were still on my mind. There was a long silence at our small round table. He looked at me and stared into my eyes. Suddenly he spoke. &#x201c;Jack, you don&#x2019;t have the balls to enlist in the Marines and go to Vietnam.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wanna bet, Tom?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Recruiter<br> &nbsp;<br> There is courage in alcohol. I am here this morning with Tom Dunnigan at the Marine Corps recruiting station, which is nothing more than a trailer in the corner of a large parking lot at the shopping mall on Route 59 in Nanuet, a town just west of Nyack.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am walking slowly, not because of apprehension but because Tom can&#x2019;t walk fast. He limps along slowly with his cane. We are an odd pair as we approach the trailer: a limping Vietnam veteran and me, sporting my 1960s-style long hair, a trademark of my rebellious generation.<br> &nbsp;<br> This July 1967, the Marines are offering the option of enlisting for as little as two years of active duty. After two years, you are discharged. It&#x2019;s kind of a Vietnam War special. But there&#x2019;s a catch: If you enlist for only two years of active duty, you are sent to Vietnam with the infantry. A two-year enlistee receives no specialized training for a career when he becomes a civilian again. There would be no computer school, no air traffic control school, and no radar technician school. The two-year enlistee would be trained as infantry&#x2014; learning about rifles, machine guns, grenades, flamethrowers, bayonets, killing&#x2014;and sent to Vietnam.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m face-to-face with the Marine recruiter sitting at his desk inside the trailer. The recruiter has been to Vietnam and wears ribbons and medals on his chest. He forewarns me, before letting me sign the proper papers, that as a Marine in the jungles of Vietnam it will be no party. He is saying there&#x2019;s a good chance I will be wounded or killed. To emphasize his point, he takes a long, hard look at Tom, who is sitting next to me at the desk. The recruiter is staring at the side of Tom&#x2019;s head that holds the steel plate to keep his skull closed. That&#x2019;s the wound he got in the country where I am going. The recruiter is trying to make sure I get the message before I sign. The message I am getting is this: Though the recruiter has an obligation to recruit, he is not in the meat business. The Vietnam War is escalating as I sit here. In Vietnam, more American soldiers are dying every day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where do I sign?&#x201d; The recruiter shakes his head in disbelief. I don&#x2019;t think he wants me to enlist. I sign the papers and he half-heartedly takes them from me, one at a time. He tells me I will be hearing from him when the necessary arrangements are complete, then he suggests I get drunk, and stay drunk, until I hear from him. So I do.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tom and I are drinking beer again, and he has a big grin on his face as he tells me that I have no idea what I&#x2019;ve gotten myself into, enlisting in the Marine Corps. He spends the afternoon trying to prepare me.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Following Morning<br> &nbsp;<br> Awakening at my parent&#x2019;s home on Mill Street, I break the news of my enlistment. My mother is disbelieving, upset, and worried about the possibility of losing me in Vietnam. She says I should have joined the army. My dad is proud but worried. American soldiers are dying in Vietnam.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whitehall Street<br> &nbsp;<br> I report to Whitehall Street in New York City. The government building has worn stone steps, and as I climb them I wonder how many thousands of men before me have come up this staircase. Draftees and enlistees from adjacent counties report here to receive a physical examination. Inside, the Whitehall building is a zoo. Men crowd the hallways: conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War, divinity students who have come for a deferral, married men with children to support, and men from apple pie America who think they are doing the right thing going to this war. There are long-haired hippies wearing love beads and several men talking to themselves, feigning mental illness. Others complain of back pain, which they probably don&#x2019;t have.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have passed the physical, the hearing test, the sight test, and the grab-your-nuts-and-cough test. I have left barefoot prints in the powder in a black rubber tray on the floor. The impressions show that I am not flat footed. I can walk and march.<br> &nbsp;<br> Destination Parris Island<br> &nbsp;<br> Our bus from New York City crosses the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River, then carries us to Newark Airport in New Jersey. At the airport I board a propeller-driven commercial airliner that will take us to Charleston, South Carolina. This flight, my first ever, is bumpy.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is scorching hot on the Charleston airport&#x2019;s tarmac. The Marines are sending a bus from Parris Island to transport us to their boot camp.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Winter Duke</h2><p><b>She survived the curse.

Hepburn starred in many great films including <i>Roman Holiday</i>, <i>Sabrina</i>, <i>Funny Face</i>, <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s</i>, <i>My Fair Lady</i> and, of course, <i>Charade</i>, the movie that started the craze for her famous pillbox hat, much loved by Jackie Kennedy.

From Givenchy, Mr. John and Dior to Cecil Beaton and Balenciaga, Hepburn inspired loyalty, set trends and cemented reputations.

Lee, he was "a meteor shining from a clouded sky"; and to Braxton Bragg, he was an officer "ever alive to a success." He was Patrick Ronayne Cleburne, one of the greatest of all Confederate field commanders. <br><br>An Irishman by birth, Cleburne emigrated to the United States in 1849 at the age of 21. He achieved only modest success in the peacetime South, but rose rapidly in the wartime army to become the Confederacy's finest division commander. He was admired by peers and subordinates alike for his leadership, loyalty, honesty, and fearlessness in the face of enemy fire. The valor of his command was so inspirational that his unit alone was allowed to carry its own distinctive battle flag. <br><br>In <i>Stonewall of the West</i>, Craig Symonds offers the first full-scale critical biography of this compelling figure. He explores all the sources of Cleburne's commitment to the Southern cause, his growth as a combat leader from Shiloh to Chickamauga, and his emergence as one of the Confederacy's most effective field commanders at Missionary Ridge, Ringgold Gap, and Pickett's Mill. In addition, Symonds unravels the "mystery" of Spring Hill and recounts Cleburne's dramatic and untimely death (at the age of 36) at Franklin, Tennessee, where he charged the enemy line on foot after having two horses shot from under him. <br><br>Symonds also explores Cleburne's role in the complicated personal politics of the Army of Tennessee, as well as his astonishing proposal that the decimated Confederate ranks be filled by ending slavery and arming blacks against the Union. <br><br>Symonds' definitive and immensely readable narrative casts new light on Cleburne, on the Army of Tennessee, and on the Civil War in the West.

The seminal rap group brought jazz into the genre to create masterpieces such as The Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders. Seventeen years after their last album, they resurrected themselves with an intense, socially conscious record, We Got It from Here...Thank You 4 Your Service, which arrived when fans needed it most, in the aftermath of the 2016 election. Hanif Abdurraqib digs into the group&#39;s history and draws from his own experience to reflect on how its distinctive sound resonated among fans like himself. Abdurraqib traces the Tribe&#39;s creative career, from their early days as part of the Afrocentric rap collective known as the Native Tongues, through their first three classic albums, to their eventual breakup and long hiatus. Their work is placed in the context of the broader rap landscape of the 1990s, one upended by sampling laws, the East Coast-West Coast rivalry that threatened to destroy the genre, and some record labels&#39; shift from focusing on groups to individual MCs. Throughout the narrative Abdurraqib connects the music and cultural history to their street-level impact, seeking deeper truths that are not simply heard in the head, but felt in the chest.</p><p></p><h2>Hope Sparks: A Post-Apocalyptic Survival Thriller (After the EMP)</h2><p><b>Six weeks into the apocalypse, would you have hope?</b>&nbsp;From an emergency landing, to a full-blown riot, to a militia gone rogue, Colt and Walter have survived it all.

As a teacher, he placed special emphasis on koan practice, inventing many new koans himself, including the famous &#x201c;What is the sound of one hand clapping?&#x201d; As an artist, Hakuin used calligraphy and painting to create &#x201c;visual Dharma&#x201d;&#x2014;teachings that powerfully express the nature of enlightenment. The text translated here offers an excellent introduction to the work of this extraordinary teacher. Hakuin sets forth his vision of authentic Zen teaching and practice, condemning his contemporaries, whom he held responsible for the decline of Zen, and exhorting his students to dedicate themselves to &#x201c;breaking through the Zen barrier.&#x201d; Included are reproductions of several of Hakuin&#x2019;s finest calligraphies and paintings.</p><p>Hakuin is the most important of the Japanese Zen artists; indeed, he is one of the greatest artists of any kind in world culture.

With this in our grasp, we have the capacity for robust intellectual and cultural engagement, confidently entering the public sphere of ideas where atheism, postmodernism and science come into play. This book explores how the great tradition of Christian theological reflection enriches faith. It deepens our appreciation of the gospel's ability to engage with the complexities of the natural world on the one hand and human experience on the other.</p><p>Alister McGrath (D.Phil. D.D., Oxford University) holds the chair of theology, ministry and education and is head of the Centre for Theology, Religion Culture at King's College, London. He is the author of many books, including <em>Christianity's Dangerous Idea</em> and <em>The Dawkins Delusion?</em>"McGrath skillfully translates his own deep learning into a delightfully accessible and enjoyable reading experience. . . . I certainly experienced the soul-stirring thrill of a sharp, devout mind debunking the old familiar, dubious claims against Christianity's intellectual coherence and credibility." (Tony Richie, The Pneuma Review, Spring 2012)<br><br>"For McGrath, the study of theology isn't a disengaged and abstract exercise; rather, it finds its authentic purpose and best expression when put into practice in the local church." (Relevant, November-December 2010)<br><br>"McGrath, a prominent theologian and public intellectual, explains how Christian thinking can and must have a positive role in shaping, nourishing, and safeguarding the Christian vision of reality." (Kathleen Samuelson, CBA Retailers Resources, August 2010)<br><br>"McGrath's attempt to show that science is not necessarily a foe to faith is admirable." (Trevin Wax, Christianity Today, August 2010)<br><br>"McGrath brings his prodigious intellect and broad learning to bear on a number of topics, including apologetics, science and religion, and the new atheism. He demonstrates that theology is 'intellectually stimulating and exciting.' This book should whet the reader's appetite for further exploration of theology." (Millard Erickson, author of Christian Theology)<br><br>"In <em>The Passionate Intellect,</em> Alister McGrath provides engaging, accessible, energetic help for Christians who are skeptical about the existential relevance of Christian theology, or who have come to doubt its credibility in the face of the attacks of new atheists and those wedded to a shallow scientism. This series of essays not only provides important support for believers seeking their footing in the current cultural morass, but can also stimulate a new curiosity about the intellectual and spiritual fruitfulness and integrity of the theological enterprise as a whole. It is obviously written by one who, well informed about alternatives to Christian faith, finds in that faith a source of life and of intellectual pleasure." (Marguerite Shuster, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"This book is not only about the passionate intellect; it exhibits the phenomenon on every page. Drawing on the rich heritage of Christian faith and practice, McGrath is as much on his home ground in engaging contemporary issues in faith and culture, especially the relation to science. The author argues that good theology not only explains but transforms, and in this well-researched and eminently readable work it's easy to see what he means. <em>The Passionate Intellect</em> is a feast that will delight, provoke and challenge as well as inform us all." (Michael Horton, Westminster Seminary California)</p><h2>Ana of California: A Novel</h2><p><b>A modern take on the classic coming-of-age novel, inspired by <i>Anne of Green Gables</i></b><br><br>In the grand tradition of <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, <i>Bridget Jones&#x2019;s Diary</i>, and <i>The Three Weissmanns of Westport</i>, Andi Teran&#x2019;s captivating debut novel offers a contemporary twist on a beloved classic. Fifteen-year-old orphan Ana Cortez has just blown her last chance with a foster family. It&#x2019;s a group home next&#x2014;unless she agrees to leave East Los Angeles for a farm trainee program in Northern California.<br><br>When she first arrives, Ana can&#x2019;t tell a tomato plant from a blackberry bush, and Emmett Garber is skeptical that this slight city girl can be any help on his farm. His sister Abbie, however, thinks Ana might be just what they need. Ana comes to love Garber Farm, and even Emmett has to admit that her hard work is an asset. But when she inadvertently stirs up trouble in town, Ana is afraid she might have ruined her last chance at finding a place to belong.</p><p><b>ANDI TERAN</b>, a native of El Paso, Texas, currently lives in Los Angeles. Ana of California is her first novel.<p></p><p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>She was out of beginnings, this she knew.</p><p>Ana ran her hands through her knotted hair, wondering when she&#x2019;d last washed it. She&#x2019;d been up for more than twenty-four hours, and there was still ketchup on her shirt.</p><p>&#x201c;This is the fifth home you&#x2019;ve been expelled from in the last ten years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To be fair, it was only four. I was at the Mitchell house twice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, this time it&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a situation.&#x201d;</p><p>Ana stared at the wall behind the desk. She&#x2019;d seen the corkboard many times before and had studied the photographs of Mrs. Saucedo&#x2019;s children over the years. She&#x2019;d watched them grow older, lose teeth, win ribbons, and pose for class photos. There was always a birthday card or thank-you note pushpinned to the board. Today it was a small California license plate bearing the word MOM.</p><p>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s been hard, but we need to find a solution,&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo said, adjusting her glasses. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like us to work together on this.&#x201d;</p><p>Ana let her eyes roam around the room. The walls were still a pale industrial green, and there was a fake tree in the corner, the same one with the rubber branches that would never grow. She remembered the first time she saw the tree and how it had been strung with lights and ornaments. There were reindeer, paper stars, and angels made of tin. One branch was weighed down by a heavy gourd, the middle hollowed out to hold figurines of a man and a woman staring down at a baby, a glittered star hanging above them. She remembered how she wanted to climb inside the gourd and live there forever.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Feliz Navidad</i>,&#x201d; Ana said, still staring at the tree. &#x201c;Those were the first words you said to me.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Saucedo looked down at her desk. Everything was in its place save for Ana&#x2019;s file, which was thick and open to a photo of a little girl in a pink puffy coat.</p><p>&#x201c;I remember,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;It was cold, not like today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, it was.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was the first time I ever wished for snow&#x2014;not that it would ever happen.&#x201d;</p><p>Ana shifted in the chair. The armrests were worn and rough under her fingertips.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like to talk about what happened that night?&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo asked, knowing Ana never did.</p><p>This time, though, Ana did want to talk about it. She remembered everything, every detail. Back then, it was referred to as &#x201c;an accident,&#x201d; and also, &#x201c;the incident,&#x201d; but Ana chose to name it as you would a melodramatic poem or story&#x2014;&#x201c;With Sorrow and Black Doves<i>.</i>&#x201d; She was the only one who had seen what had happened the night she was brought in to child services, and every time she entered Mrs. Saucedo&#x2019;s small office, the memories of The Night That Started It All returned harsh and fast. She&#x2019;d managed to shut them away year after year, but there, in that windowless room, the images flickered in the periphery.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to if you don&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo said, keeping her voice soft and slow, trying to catch Ana&#x2019;s eyes, which remained fixed on the tree.</p><p>If there was anyone she could talk to it was Mrs. Lupe Saucedo, the nice lady behind the desk who genuinely cared about her well-being&#x2014;even after all these years. Though she hadn&#x2019;t felt it physically since they&#x2019;d met almost a decade ago, Mrs. Saucedo&#x2019;s warmth remained. She remembered how the woman&#x2019;s arms had embraced her that day and how the scent of roses and clean cotton still tickled her nose. Mrs. Saucedo had whispered to her back then too.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;<i>Ya me canso de llorar y no amanece.</i>&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not crying and you do have hope.&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo sighed. &#x201c;Please, this isn&#x2019;t a telenovela. Like I&#x2019;ve told you many times before, the drama does you no favors.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a line from a song, not a comment on my psychological state.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m glad to hear you still speaking Spanish. I think your grandma would be proud.&#x201d;</p><p>Almost as a reflex, Ana&#x2019;s hands squeezed the armrests of the chair. She kept her eyes focused anywhere but on Mrs. Saucedo&#x2019;s face and concentrated instead on her own breathing. She wanted to speak but feared giving in to her tears, so she dipped her chin to her chest.</p><p>What she wanted to tell Mrs. Saucedo was that the line had been from her grandma&#x2019;s&#x2014;her <i>abuela</i>&#x2019;s&#x2014;favorite song, and that she had memorized every word. She wanted to explain that if there had been music playing on the day of the incident, it would have been this very song. She imagined the voice of a banshee swooping in to replace the screaming, how a trumpet might have substituted for blasts, and how she wished the plucking of an acoustic guitar had kept her company in the aftermath of silence, a melancholy soundtrack for the newly alone.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t speak it as much as I should,&#x201d; Ana said, instead tucking her hands between her knees, which wouldn&#x2019;t stop bouncing.</p><p>&#x201c;You understand I have nowhere left to send you, yes? We talked about three strikes less than a year ago, and since then you&#x2019;ve gone from the group home to another failed foster situation. This is it&#x2014;no more homes, no more chances,&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo said. &#x201c;It might help to talk about what happened that night, talk about your abuela, and talk about what we can do to get you to where she&#x2019;d want you to be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s all right with you, I&#x2019;d rather talk about what&#x2019;s been going on the past few months.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Saucedo had heard complaints about foster parents before. She anticipated an elaborate explanation, knowing Ana&#x2019;s flair for the dramatic. In her younger years, Ana&#x2019;s stories were wildly embellished but had since boiled down to silent defiance after being removed from her third foster home.</p><p>&#x201c;I spoke with Ms. Fenton.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m desperate to hear what she had to say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think you know exactly what she said.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you had any idea how we&#x2019;ve been treated all summer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ana&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;And how the rules were completely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your place to step in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it wasn&#x2019;t right, and someone needed to do something because no one ever does.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand the conditions were not the best,&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo said, trying not to raise her voice. &#x201c;And for that I apologize. But Ms. Fenton is a longtime foster mother, and despite the strict household, it is not your job to tell her how to discipline the other children.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, I&#x2019;m just supposed to sit there and let two little kids go without any food for the second day in a row? I&#x2019;m supposed to kick back while the so-called mother of the house eats the freezer and shelves clean just to prove a stupid point? It&#x2019;s Ludicrous, capital L.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t give any of us lunch or dinner&#x2014;like zero food&#x2014;anytime she feels we&#x2019;re doing something wrong, which is pretty much all the time. She got angry that I gave an ice cream sandwich to the kids to share, and I get that it was the last one in the freezer and everything, but it was all we had. And she took it out on them. It&#x2019;s not the first time it&#x2019;s happened, either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ms. Fenton relayed to me that you were combative and inappropriate, and while I disagree wholeheartedly with her methods, I do not condone your response to them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Believe me, I can skip a ton of meals, but the kids? She takes their toys away and never lets them play, as if their lives weren&#x2019;t completely messed up already, as if we weren&#x2019;t starving enough. So, yeah, something needed to be done. Sorry but not sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was unaware this was going on,&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo said, taking a breath. &#x201c;I understand your point, but staging a death scene isn&#x2019;t funny and you know it.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Saucedo thought she detected a smile. Ana sometimes smiled when she was uncomfortable, rarely when she was proud or defiant. It was a habit that often led to miscommunication.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what we were doing,&#x201d; Ana said, sitting up and looking at Mrs. Saucedo for the first time. &#x201c;Like I said, there was nothing in the cupboards and only ketchup in the fridge, so I told the kids to imagine they were eating hamburgers. I squirted ketchup in their mouths, and we pretended we were so full we couldn&#x2019;t get up from the floor. It was just a stupid game&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something I made up to take their minds off things.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Saucedo had a hard time believing that had been the extent of it.</p><p>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you been going to the recreation center for lunch?&#x201d; she asked, remembering Ana and her foster siblings were part of the Summer Food Program. &#x201c;Hasn&#x2019;t Ms. Fenton been making sure that you go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t let us out of the house a few times this week because she was angry that I stayed late at the library. Sometimes when she gets angry, she punishes all of us and says we&#x2019;re &#x2018;putting her in a mood.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s a mood I like to call completely insane.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Saucedo kept her eyes on Ana.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not making this up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never said you were.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really, Mrs. S., she&#x2019;s the most deplorable woman. I don&#x2019;t mean to call you out or criticize the way things are done around here or anything, but the way you guys pick foster parents sucks. I know it was stupid to leave, and I know I&#x2019;ve done it a few times before, but after she refused to feed us again, after so many days with no lunch, and after we were forced to sit on the couch while she inhaled a bag of Cheetos without offering us any and then told everyone it was all my fault&#x2014;you have to understand why I had to get out of there. But I wasn&#x2019;t making a run for it, I swear. I was going to get something for everyone to eat.&#x201d;</p><p>Ana chewed her bottom lip and kept her hands folded in her lap. She looked down at her ripped jeans, focusing on the misshapen hearts and stars drawn all over her exposed kneecaps, the remnants of an afternoon spent playing &#x201c;art school&#x201d; with her foster brother and sister, the two she knew she&#x2019;d probably never see again.</p><p>&#x201c;Not to elaborate, but she made us do all the housework too. Honestly, I don&#x2019;t mind, but if there was toothpaste on the mirror, or if I didn&#x2019;t iron all the wrinkles out of her shirts, she would take it out on all of us. I tried to be nice, to do extra work. I tried to ignore the way her disgusting boyfriend used to stare at my T-shirt as if invited by a logo emblazoned across my chest, and I tried to do everything you&#x2019;ve always told me to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to say anything else,&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo said.</p><p>&#x201c;But I shouldn&#x2019;t have left like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I get it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you shouldn&#x2019;t have. Nor should you have called Ms. Fenton what you called her, regardless of how she treated you.&#x201d;</p><p>Ana had heard the sound of the screen door slam behind her as she ran out of the house. Her throat was raw and the imprint of small hands still warmed her palms. She remembered running through the gravel in the front yard and all the way down the block, ignoring the heat of the sidewalk seeping into her sneakers. She couldn&#x2019;t remember how far she&#x2019;d gone or why she&#x2019;d neglected to say good-bye, knowing, even then, that she wouldn&#x2019;t be allowed to return. She had promised she&#x2019;d never leave her foster siblings there&#x2014;that she&#x2019;d never leave them period&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d broken that promise again, in the same way it had always been broken to her.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re almost sixteen,&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo said. &#x201c;You are old enough and smart enough to know how and when to rise above a situation. I know you were looking after the others, but the person you need to look after most is yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Saucedo studied Ana&#x2019;s face, which was tense; her eyes focused on clasped hands, one thumb picking at the other. She&#x2019;d seen this look before.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know you don&#x2019;t want me to get into it, but I should probably tell you that she brought up my mother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did she say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That I&#x2019;m going to end up just like her.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Saucedo took a breath. &#x201c;Is that all she said?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want you to tell me exactly what she said.&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time Ana&#x2019;s file had been used against her, if the file even allowed her to be assigned to a foster home in the first place. No one wanted to deal with a child who had been marked as difficult or traumatized.</p><p>&#x201c;She said I&#x2019;m going to end up in jail, where I quote unquote &#x2018;belong,&#x2019; if a bullet doesn&#x2019;t find me first. It&#x2019;s not like I haven&#x2019;t heard it before.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know that&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Ana said, hands gripping a bouncing knee.</p><p>&#x201c;Your parents knew what they were involved in, and the rest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. None of it was your fault,&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo said, removing her glasses and placing them on top of Ana&#x2019;s file. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve talked about how to deal with difficulty, how to temper your emotions, but we&#x2019;ve never talked about why they flare up every time you settle in to a new place. We&#x2019;re either going to talk about it now and figure out the next steps or I&#x2019;m going to have to make a decision without your input.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just put me in another foster home. I can start over again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not an option.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What if I lived with you? I can do all the housework. You can put me in the garage or something, and I&#x2019;ll babysit your kids until school starts&#x2014;really, I can help out. I&#x2019;ll be quiet, and you won&#x2019;t even see me.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Saucedo closed her eyes for a moment. She thought back to her training and reflected on her decades of experience. She reminded herself not to show any anger or sign of frustration, so she inhaled deeply, and even though it was discouraged, she thought about her own children.</p><p>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t even know I&#x2019;m there. I&#x2019;m good at washing dishes and fixing things. And I don&#x2019;t need to eat much. I can go days without food, done it many times before. And I know a million bedtime stories that my abuela told me, ones I&#x2019;m sure your kids haven&#x2019;t heard before. It&#x2019;ll just be until I&#x2019;m sixteen&#x2014;not like forever or anything.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Saucedo moved closer to Ana, who turned her body toward the door.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not crying,&#x201d; Ana said. &#x201c;My eye itches. And I&#x2019;m just sick of this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know<i>.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Honestly, I didn&#x2019;t mean to freak out and run. I&#x2019;m trying to do the right thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know you are, but that&#x2019;s not the problem.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t send me back to the group home.&#x201d;</p><p>Ana wiped her face. She told herself that if her eyes met Mrs. Saucedo&#x2019;s again, she might drown.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do anything,&#x201d; Ana said. &#x201c;Just please don&#x2019;t send me back there.&#x201d;</p><p>She felt her voice slip and knew she&#x2019;d never be able to catch it. Every breath seemed heavier and harder to swallow. She&#x2019;d been to a group home before Ms. Fenton&#x2019;s; in fact, it was the last time she&#x2019;d sat in Mrs. Saucedo&#x2019;s office arguing against another situation that had remained woefully unchecked. Ana could barely remember the faces of those who had surrounded her back then, though she could recite every word they said. Her memory flashed to the bathroom, the group of girls standing behind her as she tried not to make eye contact in the mirror. They were older and greater in number, swift and quiet in their attack. She was shoved from behind first and punched once or twice&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t remember&#x2014;before her head hit the floor. There were multiple feet near her face, that she remembered, and she&#x2019;d kept her eyes focused on the chipped tile where there was a clump of her own hair.</p><p>&#x201c;Take a breath,&#x201d; Mrs. Saucedo said and slid a box of tissues across the desk. Ana Cortez had cried in her office...</p></p><h2>Mark of the Plague (2) (The Blackthorn Key)</h2><p>Christopher Rowe is back and there are more puzzles, riddles, and secrets to uncover in this follow-up to the Indie Next pick <i>The Blackthorn Key</i>, which was called a &#x201c;spectacular debut&#x201d; by <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> in a starred review.<br><br>The Black Death has returned to London, spreading disease and fear through town.

It was five inches tall, with a bulging top balanced over a narrow upright cylinder, wrapped tightly in folded paper. The upper part of the device balanced on three wooden prongs sticking out of the bottom. A wick of cannon fuse trailed from its end.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a mushroom,&#x201d; Tom said. &#x201c;With a tail.&#x201d; He edged away from the workbench. &#x201c;A flammable tail.&#x201d;<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t help feeling slightly wounded. Odd or not, this device was the most important thing I&#x2019;d ever made. All of the other equipment in the apothecary workshop&#x2014;the ceramic jars, the molded glassware, the spoons and cups and pots and cauldrons&#x2014;lay crammed on the side benches, cold and quiet. Only the faint scent of ingredients and concoctions lingered in the room. Even the giant onion-shaped oven in the corner was still. Because this was the creation that would save my shop.<br> <br>I held it up with pride. &#x201c;Blackthorn&#x2019;s Smoke-Your-Home! Guaranteed to . . . uh . . . smoke your home. Well, that advertisement needs work.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your brain needs work,&#x201d; Tom muttered.<br> <br>Now that was going too far. &#x201c;My inventions do exactly what they&#x2019;re supposed to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Tom said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the problem.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;look.&#x201d; I put my Smoke-Your-Home back down&#x2014;gently&#x2014;and showed him my design, sketched on an unrolled sheet of vellum.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a firework,&#x201d; I said, which in retrospect was probably not the best way to start.<br><br>Blackthorn&#x2019;s Smoke-Your-Home<br> <br>Invented by Christopher Rowe, Apothecary&#x2019;s Apprentice<br> <br><br><br>&#x201c;You light the fuse at the bottom. The gunpowder in the lower part pops the top into the air. Then the second fuse makes that burst.&#x201d; I swept my arm over it like I was hawking silks at the Royal Exchange. &#x201c;Fills any room with smoke to keep your family safe! Designed to help drive off the plague!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; Tom said. I think my theatrics made him less impressed. &#x201c;Why is it full of flour?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the best part. Watch.&#x201d;<br> <br>I went to the side of the workshop, where I&#x2019;d stored the two sacks of flour I had left. I grabbed a handful of it and picked up the taper burning on the workbench. When I puffed the flour into it, it burst with a bright flash of flame.<br> <br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It explodes. That&#x2019;s what blew up Campden&#x2019;s mill last summer.

She recoiled with a grunt and took off, wings flapping her up the stairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; Tom ducked behind the workbench. &#x201c;Even the bird thinks you&#x2019;re mad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to regret this when I&#x2019;m knee-deep in gold,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Tom&#x2019;s voice called from behind the wood. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take my chances.&#x201d;<br> <br>I lit the fuse. I watched it crackle and spark, then joined Tom behind the bench. Not because I was worried, of course. It just seemed . . . prudent.<br> <br>The fuse reached the bottom. For a moment, there was nothing.<br> <br>Then the gunpowder ignited. There was a hissing, and sparks shot from the bottom. The cylinder popped into the air.<br> <br>I pulled on Tom&#x2019;s sleeve. &#x201c;It works! It works!&#x201d;<br> <br>Then the second charge began to burn. A thin, smoking flame rushed out of the bottom. Slowly, it tipped sideways.

Author Index</p><p>Edgar Morin has been urging for a shift towards complexity thinking for many decades. He has a unique capability to move between the natural and social sciences--without doing either of them any injustice--and is ideally placed to address the epistemological, ethical and practical problems of our times. What makes Morin unique amongst complexity theorists is the way in which he turns a critical eye on complexity theory itself, resisting a return to determinism, reduction and disjunction in come approaches to complexity.<br>Paul Cilliers, University of Stellenbosch--Author of&nbsp;<i>Complexity and Postmodernism</i><br><br>The biology of 21st century is moving from the reductionist approach of molecular biology to the systems approach of the new science of systems biology. More than 20 years ago Edgar Morin had already articulated the paradigm of complexity that gives us the clues needed to address the conceptual changes in modern biology.<br>Magali ROUX-ROUQUI�--Senior scientist-CNRS (French National Research Center),<br>Deputy director USAR-CNRS<br><br>Morin is a representative thinker of humanity's planetary age. In remedying the deficiency of<br>Western classic analytic thinking, Morin's complex thinking shows some affinities to the Chinese classic synthetic thinking, such as the emphasis on the union of the universal and the particular. Morin's path indicates that the creation of the paradigm of complexity depends on the fusion of Western and Eastern thinking, each of which has its strength and weakness.<br>Yi-zhuang Chen--Professor of Philosophy, Central-South University, People's Republic<br>of China<br><br>I have not been this excited about anything rooted in general system theory since reading von<br>Bertalanffy and Boulding many years ago. &nbsp;I hope that all my colleagues in organization studies will read this book and respond to it. It is deserving not only of our attention, but will be of interest to those working in all the fields of science, social science and the humanities.<br>Mary Jo Hatch--Author, <i>Organization Theory: Modern, Symbolic, and Postmodern</i><br>Perspectives, Professor Emeritus, McIntire School of Commerce, University of Virginia,<br>USA<br> Here is a discussion that takes us into the puzzling domain of self in relation to eco-organization.<br> We normally relate the notion of complexity to technical order, which has led, in Morin's phrase, to "blind intelligence." He postulates a domain of complexity in which living order has a crucial organizing role. By providing a satisfying explanation of the processes of recursion and a perspective of holism in which activities of the whole, "emergents," loop back to constrain parts, Morin's valuable presentation reveals how environment is in us.<br> Peter J. C. Haries-Jones, PhD--Emeritus Professor, York University,<br> Author of a <i>Recursive Vision: Ecological Understanding and Gregory Bateson</i><br> <br> Morin has opened the way to real thinking about human nature, not reducing it to one of its components, bio-physico-chemical, social, psychological, religious, or political. Understanding the interactions between these components without confusion is the challenge of the sciences of<br> complexity.<br> Henri Atlan--Author, <i>Enlightenment to Enlightenment: Intercritique of Science and Myth</i>,<br> Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel, EHESS, ParisPhilosopher and sociologist Edgar Morin, born in 1921, is one of France's leading contemporary thinkers. His large body of work is characterized by a concern for knowledge capable of grasping the complexity of reality and of observing the singular while placing it within the whole. We need to understand the nature of being human, Morin says. However, first we must discover that "the treasure of human unity is human diversity and that the treasure of human diversity is human unity". He presents his thinking on education in&nbsp;<i>La t�te bien faite</i>,&nbsp;<i>Relier les connaissances.</i>&nbsp;His book&nbsp;<i>Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future</i>&nbsp;(2000) has been translated into many languages.&nbsp;<br> <br> Edgar Morin has concentrated on developing a method that can meet the challenge of the complexity of our world and reform thinking, preconditions for confronting all fundamental, global problems. His numerous publications include&nbsp; the six volumes of&nbsp;<i>Method&nbsp;</i>(1977-2004),&nbsp;<i>On Complexity</i>, <i>Homeland Earth</i>, <i>California Journal</i>,&nbsp;<i>Vidal and His Family</i>,&nbsp;<i>Cinema and the Imaginary Man</i>, <i>Pour sortir du XX�me si�cle, Autocritique, New Trends in the Study of Mass Communications, Homeland Earth, La Voie.&nbsp;</i>Morin has been translated into many languages, including Chinese, English, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.&nbsp;<br> <br> Morin has received honorary doctorates in subjects ranging from political science to psychology and sociology from universities in 27 countries in the world and holds an itinerant UNESCO Chair in Complex Thought.

Leaving her twin toddlers at home in the Cotswolds with her husband, an American lawyer working in England, Lori sets off for Wyrdhurst Hall to evaluate a private library for a wealthy client who has given the castle to his niece Nicole and her new husband, Jared Hollander. But a mysteriously open gate leads Lori dangerously astray. Rescued from a potentially fatal accident by a handsome and charming stranger to whom she is immediately attracted, she resumes her journey to the gloomy Scottish estate. Once ensconced at Wyrdhurst, Lori finds the young mistress is terrified by the sounds and apparitions that haunt the castle and equally frightened of her cold and controlling husband. Lori uncovers a secret cache of letters from an earlier era that hint at a tragic love affair and a death that must be avenged before Wyrdhurst's ghost--and its present inhabitants--can rest in peace. With Aunt Dimity's magic journal warning her that danger surrounds her passionate infatuation with Adam Chase, who has his own reasons for wanting Lori to get to the bottom of the mystery, our intrepid heroine traces the ghostly apparitions to their source.

A split second after my feet hit the floor, my bottom followed. I knew I hadn't tripped or fallen over anything. When I tried to stand, I found that my legs would not hold me up. I remember feeling totally confused. What I didn't realize at the time and couldn't possibly know was that I'd just taken the first step of a lifelong journey that would ultimately provide me with a remarkable gift.<br><br> The diagnosis was multiple sclerosis, and the prognosis was that I would likely never walk again. I fell apart. As a teenager, the most important thing to me was being with my friends, something that suddenly seemed impossible. I was particularly upset because the school I had attended my whole life wasn't wheelchair accessible, which meant that I wouldn't be graduating the following year with my class. I was convinced that any kind of life worth living was over. In retrospect, having met incredible people through my work whose wheelchairs have never slowed them down, I am ashamed of the way I reacted. I am grateful that my work has given me the opportunity to learn that being "healed" and feeling "well" isn't so much a physical process as an emotional one.<br><br> I was the youngest of four children. As my dad's medical practice was well established by the time I came along, I had the privilege of spending a great deal more time with him than had my brother and sisters. Dad and I would take long walks, play tennis, and go fishing at a nearby lake. I adored my mom, but Dad and I were best buddies. Neither of us was prepared for the shock that September morning brought. My sudden illness was particularly hard on him. More than the physical implications, he worried about my mental health, I think. Dad realized that I needed to have something on which to focus, something hopeful.<br><br> As fate would have it, he had recently read about a woman in California who was training dogs to help people who used wheelchairs. Knowing how much I loved animals and hoping to give me a reason to keep fighting, he contacted the woman. Unfortunately, she couldn't send a dog as far as my hometown of Atlanta. Rather than being disappointed, Dad grew determined. He decided that a similar program was surely needed in our part of the country. On the Friday after Thanksgiving, he met with a CPA about setting up a nonprofit program he named Canine Assistants. Three weeks later, Dad was walking on the sidewalk along a nearby park when a drunk driver on a motorcycle jumped onto the path and hit him.<br><br> All night, I stayed in the waiting room of the ICU of the hospital where Dad was on staff. His coworkers flooded the hospital. He was not only a gifted surgeon, he was a wonderful man, and his friends were using all their skills to keep him alive. We kept hoping for good news that night, though it never came. Dad was broken. The hands he had used to give sight to so many were literally crushed. His brilliant brain was damaged. For most of the night, his blood pressure was almost nonexistent. Toward morning, nature overrode the heroics of modern medicine, and my dad died.<br><br> The only thing that kept me from falling into despair was my anger. If you've ever faced such dark anguish, you know what a blessing anger can be. I had to fight the adversity or die myself. I decided the best reason to continue living was to make the world better for someone else who was hurting; otherwise, life seemed like a pointless exercise in pain. I grabbed the dream of Canine Assistants and I held it like a lifeline.<br><br> Over the next several years, my illness went into full remission and I slowly regained the ability to walk. How? I was lucky. That is the best answer I have. My doctors conjectured about why my condition improved so much, but then and now that seems unimportant to me. The simple fact is clear: I got lucky.<br><br> Mom and I were not so lucky when it came to money. There was a clause in Dad's life-insurance policy that negated payout in cases of "death by two-wheeled vehicle," which was obviously intended for those riding on or driving motorcycles. The insurance company nevertheless enforced the clause in his case. Without the insurance money and the substantial cash flow Dad's medical practice had brought, money became a problem for the first time in our lives. Mom and I learned a great deal about the value of buying in bulk, shopping at discount stores, Sunday morning newspaper coupons, and weekly sales at the local grocery stores. My siblings were just beginning their adult lives, married with young children or otherwise trying to establish themselves, so they were not able to help much financially. We did get help, though, from a number of wonderful people and one remarkable woman in particular.<br><br> When I was six months old, my mom found herself thoroughly overwhelmed with four young children and her need to "support" Dad in his medical practice, which meant going out a lot and being pleasant to strangers. Who would have thought that doctors would have to play such games? Anyway, money was starting to come in from Dad's practice, so he suggested that Mom hire someone to help around the house. Through good fortune she hired a woman named Sallie Kate Brooks, one of the finest human beings I have ever known. From the beginning, Nanny, as my brother nicknamed her, was Mom's best friend and another mother to my siblings and me. After Dad died, Nanny continued to come to our home five days a week, even though we could no longer afford to pay her. Often, she would bring bags of vegetables from her husband's garden, and more than a few times she quietly paid the rent we could not afford to pay on the small apartment we now called home. Nanny helped to keep us fed and housed, but she also helped to keep us sane.<br><br> Still, it was Mom who was our foundation, the strength that kept us going. Widowed at age forty-eight, with no money, no job experience, and a hurting child, she could have gotten into her bed and pulled the covers over her head, but she didn't. Instead, she found herself a job as the receptionist for an orthopedic surgeon. Mom wasn't very good with the office typing or with the complicated phone system they used, but she was wonderful with the patients. She was one of those rare people who could make you feel like a million dollars just by spending a few minutes with you. And, if she loved you, she loved you completely. She believed so strongly in me and in the dream of Canine Assistants that she never let me quit trying to make the program a reality, pushing me when I didn't think I could go on. A few months ago, someone told me that I reminded her so much of my mother. I cried when I heard those words. I cannot imagine a greater compliment.<br><br> As Mom worked in the doctor's office, I took a variety of jobs to contribute to household needs and raise money to start Canine Assistants. I delivered pizzas. I worked in veterinary clinics, which I loved because it allowed me to learn more about dogs. I even went to farrier school and began to shoe horses. There was excellent money to be made shoeing, but my body, still weak from illness, wasn't capable of handling the physical demands of the job. We were getting by but not getting ahead, and my dream of Canine Assistants still seemed far away.<br><br> Then something wonderful happened. One day in the spring of 1990, I found a piece of property for sale by its owner about thirty miles north of Atlanta. It had several small houses, a barn, fields for the dogs to run in, and, best of all, appropriate zoning. It was the perfect place to start Canine Assistants. Just one minor problem- money. Mom and I had no credit history, so we had no ability to borrow from a bank. All I could think to do was ask the man who owned the property to finance it for us-something he really did not want to do. Day and night I badgered that sweet man until he finally relented, with one substantial condition: He wanted a ten percent down payment. Of course, we didn't have that kind of money. I was bemoaning my situation to a close friend when he surprised me. He had just received a payment from a family trust that was virtually equal to the amount I needed for the property. He lent me the money, and I bought the site on which Canine Assistants still stands.</p><h2>Bodily Harm</h2><p><b>From the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Handmaid's Tale</i></b><br><br>Rennie Wilford is a journalist who writes about the latest trends and considers herself an expert on the superficial surfaces of life.

Each story is first presented in the original Old Irish and then in English so that a reader can experience the story as it existed in the original before reading a new translation. Many of the existing translations are around a hundred years old, and often either exclude material or else skew the retelling to fit the mores of a more Victorian audience. The translations included here in stories including The Struggle of the Two Swineherds and the Wooing of Emer are an attempt to find a balance between a more literal translation that is still enjoyable to an English speaking audience. Material included focuses on the Irish Gods and related mythic beings, as well as some fragments of wisdom texts.</p><p></p><h2>The Hidden Parables: Activating the Secret of the Gospels</h2><p><b>The secret and empowering messages contained within Christ&#x2019;s thirty parables&#x2014;an astonishing and practical blueprint for the life you are destined for.</b><br>In <i>The Hidden Parables</i>, Dr. Todd Michael unveils a hidden layer of meaning within the thirty enigmatic parables spoken by Christ that shows that the parables are not a random collection of stories but a <i>unified system of knowledge</i>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This integrated system of knowledge describes how to use the spiritual law of thought forms&#x2014;of controlled intentions&#x2014;to create more beneficial, more miraculous circumstances in our personal lives.

The Dutch Grandmaster combined his brilliant successes on the board with a passion for writing and meticulously analysing his own games and those of his rivals. Three times he was a World Championship Candidate and in 1993 he played in the final of the FIDE World Championship, a match that he lost to Anatoly Karpov. <br><br>In this fascinating book, Jan Timman portrays ten World Chess Champions that played an important role in his life and career. Champions that not only inspired him, but also champions he did battle with. Alexander Alekhine (1892-1946) he never met, but the story of how in Lisbon he bought one of the last chess sets belonging to the fourth World Champion is one of many highlights in the book. Also there is the time when he visited Mikhail Botvinnik in his dacha outside Moscow and watches &#x2018;the Patriarch' put on one of the browned laurel wreaths that he won decades ago.<br><br>Timman has a keen eye for detail, a fabulous memory and he visibly enjoys sharing his insider views, including many revelations of the great champions. Timman's Titans not only presents a personal view of these chess giants, but is also a wonderful evocation of countless fascinating episodes in chess history. <br><br>Each portrait is completed by a rich selection of illustrative games, annotated in the author's trademark lucid style. Always to the point, sharp and with crystal-clear explanations Timman shows the highs and lows from the games of the champions, including the most memorable games that he himself played against them.</p><p>Jan Timman is a former world championship candidate who rose to the number two spot of the FIDE world rankings. He is the author of several highly acclaimed bestsellers, such as Curacao 1962, On the Attack!, Power Chess with Pieces and The Art of the Endgame."One of the finest chess books that have recently been published (..) Although Timman doesn't keep silent about matters such as match-fixing, abuse of power or excessive drinking, he writes his portraits with a fundamentally positive view. The joy with which the book is written works contagious." (Jeroen Bosch, International Master <i>Schaakmagazine</i>)<br><br>"A very interesting book, full of anecdotes I have never seen elsewhere (..) Entertaining and instructive, 'Timman's Titans' is also Timman's finest." (Sean Marsh <i>CHESS Magazine (UK)</i>)<br><br>"The many anecdotes will change the views of quite a few readers (..) A classic." (B.H. Wilders <i>Nederlands Dagblad</i>)<br><br>"Even chess insiders will find in the stories a lot of information they don't know (..) I have always been a fan of Timman's way of annotating games. He makes what happens on the board very easily accessible, so much so that you feel yourself fully immersed in the secrets of the game."

But what role does place play in the Christian life and how might our theology of place be cultivated? In this Studies in Theology and the Arts volume, Jennifer Allen Craft argues that the arts are a significant form of placemaking in the Christian life. The arts, she contends, place us in time, space, and community in ways that encourage us to be fully and imaginatively present in a variety of contexts: the natural world, our homes, our worshiping communities, and society. In so doing, the arts call us to pay attention to the world around us and invite us to engage in responsible practices in those places. Through this practical theology of the arts, Craft shows how the arts can help us by cultivating our theological imagination, giving shape to the Christian life, and forming us more and more into the image of Christ.</p><p>Jennifer Allen Craft (PhD, University of St. Andrews) is associate professor of humanities and theology at Point University in West Point, Georgia, where she teaches courses in theology, philosophy, and the arts. Her work has been featured on <em>Transpositions</em> and in <em>Contemporary Art and the Church: A Conversation Between Two Worlds</em>."Jennifer Allen Craft is one of the most important emerging voices in theology and the arts today. This book provides a fascinating exploration of the arts in relation to place, a much-neglected topic. Lucid and lively, it deserves to be very widely read." (Jeremy Begbie, Duke University)<br><br>"This book performs an extraordinary service within the literature of theology and the arts. In far too many cases that conversation has held the arts at arm's length, believing that such cultural entanglements are merely optional. Craft's treatment of art as placemaking resists that foolishness by demonstrating that there is no neutral ground for human life and artistry (i.e., no nonplaced experience). Rather than avoiding the inherent tensions of art and place, she embraces the wonder of God's redemptive activity in a broken world. Through her careful consideration of how the arts enable us to embody a sense of home, experience more rooted and contextualized worship, extend hospitality to friends or strangers, or navigate our place in the world, we come to see that geography and culture mutually determine one another for good or ill. We should be thankful for the ways in which Craft's theological aesthetic of placemaking can restore us to our own imaginations, embedded as they are in specific times and particular communities. More than that, we should accept her invitation to renew these connections with the mutually transformative love of Christ." (Taylor Worley, associate professor of faith and culture at Trinity International University)<br><br>"Jennifer Craft offers a profound exploration of how art may help us adjust the ways in which we see and inhabit places, and so live in God's world with greater sensitivity, faithfulness, and love. This engaging book is a rich contribution to the growing conversation about theology and place." (Murray Rae, department of theology and religion, University of Otago)<br><br>"Jennifer Allen Craft's <em>Placemaking and the Arts</em> is an elegant and illuminating meditation on the importance of our lived environments. We are called, as both stewards and sojourners, to be deeply present to God's sensory creation&#x2015;first by recognizing our rootedness within it and second by cultivating it as we were made to do. For Craft, the arts should be understood as the fruit of this connection and care, adorning and shaping the world for all of God's children. Drawing on a wide range of theological insights, <em>Placemaking and the Arts</em> points the way toward more humane and hospitable environments today." (Katie Kresser, professor of art at Seattle Pacific University)<br><br>"In this marvelous book, Jennifer Craft shows us how God is in the business of making grace happen in our respective places on earth&#x2015;<em>this</em> soil, <em>this</em> house, <em>this</em> street, <em>this</em> climate, <em>this</em> city, <em>this</em> people. What she offers the reader is not only a sorely needed theology of place but also a compelling vision for how the arts inspire us to create hospitable places that anticipate our life together in a fully emplaced kingdom economy." (W. David O. Taylor, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"After a couple of generations of neglect and disinvestment, I'm delighted to see that place is being rediscovered within the Christian community as an important aspect of human flourishing. <em>Placemaking and the Arts</em> makes a significant contribution to this movement. In this book Craft develops a comprehensive theological framework for thinking about how the arts can help place us in time, space, and community. And she makes a convincing case for how art must play a critical role in any recovery of place. Many have expressed concern about the place of art in contemporary life; Craft helpfully extends this conversation to consider the role of art in place (and placemaking). Highly recommended." (Eric O. Jacobsen, senior pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Tacoma, author of The Space Between: A Christian Engagement with the Built Environment)<br><br>"This brilliant book engages with a burgeoning interest in both the significance of place and the importance of the arts in God's way with the world, synthesizing the two in an impressively insightful and imaginative fashion. It is highly scholarly and at the same time accessible. I am full of admiration for what the author has achieved and hope the book will be as influential as it certainly deserves to be."

The trip quickly turns threatening when one climber never shows up, climbing equipment fails, and Chuck and his spouse, Janelle Ortega, are suspected in the shocking, present&#x2013;day death of one of Chuck's former rock&#x2013;climbing partners. Together, Chuck and Janelle race against time to solve the dual mysteries and prove their innocence&#x2014;all while facing down a ruthless killer on the loose.<p></p></p><p>Scott Graham is the author of eight books, including the National Park Mystery Series from Torrey House Press, and <i>Extreme Kids</i>, winner of the National Outdoor Book Award. Graham is an avid outdoorsman who enjoys mountaineering, skiing, hunting, rock climbing, and whitewater rafting with his wife, who is an emergency physician, and their two sons. He lives in Durango, Colorado.Chapter 1 <br>Twelve-year-old Carmelita was fifteen feet off the ground and climbing higher, her yellow T-shirt bright in the morning sun, before Chuck, caught off guard by her speedy ascent, reacted. He retrieved the growing slack in the climbing rope, sliding the line past his brake hand and through the belay device attached to his waist harness. The rope's braided sheath warmed his skin as it slipped through his cupped palm. Thin as a whiffle bat, her navy tights hanging in loose folds from her tiny thighs and calves, Carmelita balanced the rubber soles of her climbing shoes on the resin holds bolted to the climbing tower and grasped additional holds above her head with chalked fingers, hoisting herself skyward. "Take it easy," Chuck called up to her, pride edging his voice, as he took up the last of the slack in the rope. "Give me a chance to keep up, would you?" She hesitated for only a heartbeat before climbing higher, her helmeted head back, her moves smooth and fluid as she moved from hold to hold up the vertical tower. Chuck shot a grin at Janelle, who stood beside him in a form-fitting fleece top and black yoga pants. "You sure she hasn't snuck off and done this before without our knowing it?" His grin widened as he looked back up at Carmelita. A sweet spot, that's where he found himself, three years into parenthood, on a working vacation with his family in the heart of Yosemite National Park on this sunny mid-August morning, hired to explore a pair of confounding, hundred-and-fifty-year-old murders here in Yosemite Valley. Everything on this day was right in his world. Perfect. A loner turned sudden husband to Janelle and stepdad to Carmelita and Rosie three years ago, Chuck was well settled in to his new life by now, taking off for his morning runs with Janelle before the girls awoke, working in his small study in the back of the house during school hours, helping Janelle with household chores and the girls with their homework in the evenings. He bid for most of his work close to Durango these days, too, assuring he made it home on weekends when he conducted the fieldwork portion of his contracts. His morning runs kept him lean and fit at forty-five, fifteen years Janelle's senior, even as gray spread from his sideburns through the rest of his scalp and new wrinkles pleated the edges of his mouth, matching the crow's feet that for years had creased the sun-scorched corners of his eyes. Above Chuck, Carmelita continued her smooth ascent. Her bravura climb in front of the crowd of a couple dozen onlookers at the foot of the tower, so out of character for her, took him aback. Such brash public displays weren't like her. Rather, they were the province of her openly exuberant ten-year-old sister, Rosie. He took in an arm's length of rope. Another sidelong glance revealed a smile on Janelle's face that matched his own as she watched her older daughter's confident moves up the portable, forty-foot climbing tower, which was raised on hydraulic arms from the bed of a flatbed trailer attached to a parked semi-truck at the edge of the Camp 4 parking lot. Janelle's smile reinforced what she'd told Chuck in their crew-cab pickup last night, after the girls had fallen asleep in the rear seat as they'd driven deep into the night on the way here from Colorado. She'd spoken softly, so as not to awaken the girls, of her pride at having passed the last of her Emergency Medical Technician certification courses, her paramedic application now pending with Durango Fire and Rescue. "She must have gotten this from you," Janelle said at Chuck's side, her olive face turned skyward. Her dark hair, long and silky, hung free down her back, and a tiny gemstone glittered in the side of her small, pointed nose. "Not me." Chuck took up more slack, maintaining slight tension on the line to assure it would catch Carmelita the instant she fell&#x2014;if she fell. "I was always a grunter. I climbed by force of will. But look at her. She's defying gravity, and she's doing it with pure grace." Carmelita passed the tower's halfway point, moving higher despite the decreasing size and number of holds on the top half of the structure. She grasped the undersized resin grips with the tips of her fingers, her weight on her toes. The climbing rope extended from her harness to a pulley at the top of the wall and back down to Chuck in the parking lot below. Her chestnut hair, gathered in a pony tail, gleamed in the sunlight beneath the back of her helmet. She showed no hint of fear as she passed thirty feet off the ground, nearing the top of the tower. "You go, girl!" Janelle's brother and Chuck's assistant, Clarence, called to Carmelita from where he stood thirty feet back from the base of the tower with the other onlookers, several of whom waited their turn to climb when Carmelita finished. Clarence tucked his shoulder-length black hair behind his silver-earring-studded ears and raised his hands in a two-fisted salute, the sleeves of his black T-shirt climbing his pudgy upper arms toward his shoulders, his jeans riding low on his hips beneath his sizable gut. "Yeah! You go, girl!" ten-year-old Rosie echoed from where she watched at her uncle's side. Rosie's stocky frame contrasted sharply with that of her slight sister. She could have been her uncle's twin, however, he with his squat physique and pot belly, if not for the difference in their ages. "No way am I going up that thing," Rosie declared. She hooked her thumbs through the belt loops of her shorts. "No frickin' way." "Rosie!" Janelle admonished. Her reprimand was halfhearted, however, focused as she was on Carmelita three stories overhead. Janelle put her hand to her brow, shielding the sun. "Isn't that high enough?" she asked Chuck. "She might send it," Chuck replied, agog. "She might actually top out." Carmelita continued to clamber upward, the widely spaced holds at the top of the tower presenting her no discernible difficulty until, as if by levitation alone, she was forty feet off the ground and there was no more climbing to be done. After giving the top of the fiberglass tower a tap, she leaned back in her harness as Chuck had instructed, her feet flat on the wall. She shook out her hands at her sides while he held her in place, his brake hand gripping the rope. "How's the view from up there, sweetness?" he called up to her. She looked at the granite cliffs lining the valley thousands of feet above the top of the tower. "I've got a ways to go." At Chuck's side, Janelle shivered. "Don't get any big ideas, nina." Chuck relaxed his grip and lowered Carmelita, the rope running through his palm. "I'm glad I belayed her," he said to Janelle as Carmelita walked backward down the wall while he played the rope through his hand. "As light as she is, I wouldn't have wanted to trust the auto-belay to kick in and catch her." When Carmelita reached the ground, the tower attendant, blond haired, thickly bearded, and in his mid-twenties, approached from where he'd been talking with a female climber his age. The attendant's broad shoulders extended from his tank top straight as a crossbeam. His powerful quads filled the legs of his shorts. The woman climber, waiting her turn on the tower beyond the line of large boulders between the parking lot and campground, wore a magenta bikini top and shiny black climbing tights cut low across her hips. Her bare stomach was tanned and flat. A gold ring sparkled where it pierced the skin above her navel. At the foot of the tower, the heavily muscled attendant untied the rope from Carmelita's waist. "Good going," he praised her, offering his meaty palm for a high-five. Carmelita slapped his hand and pranced over to Janelle and Chuck, a grin plastered on her face. "That was a blast." "You made it look easy," Janelle said. "It was easy." Chuck lifted an eyebrow at the bright-eyed youngster before him. "Not for mere mortals." He freed the climbing rope from his harness, allowing the attendant to set about reattaching the rope to the cylindrical auto-belay mechanism at the tower's base. Carmelita's white teeth flashed. "When can I do it again?" Chuck cocked his head at the climbers grouped and waiting behind the line of boulders separating the parking area from Camp 4. Jimmy O'Reilly stood at the front of the group, deep in conversation with Bernard Montilio, the two men clearly enjoying the opportunity to catch up with each other after all these years. "The line got pretty long behind Jimmy while you were up there," Chuck said. "I'm glad we came over first thing this morning." He hesitated, avoiding Janelle's gaze, the idea coming to him even as the words formed in his mouth. "The only way you're going to get to climb any more this weekend is if you enter the Slam." "The what?" Carmelita asked. Janelle stiffened beside him as he continued. "The Yosemite Slam, Camp 4's big climbing competition. It starts tomorrow and runs for two days, through Sunday. That's why the tower's here. Jimmy timed it for this weekend to coincide with the reunion. He started it a few years ago to raise money for his nonprofit organization, the Camp 4 Fund, which supports the campground. The Slam has gotten bigger every year. Once it begins, entrants will be the only ones allowed on the tower." Carmelita begged Janelle, "Can I, Mama?" Janelle turned to Chuck, her smile gone. "A climbing competition? Aren't those for adults?" "The best sport climbers in the world these days are teenagers. Their strength-to-weight ratios are off the charts thanks to the fact that&#x2014;" he encircled Carmelita's upper arm with a finger and thumb "&#x2014;they're so skinny." "But that's teenagers you're talking about." "I'll be thirteen in December," Carmelita reminded her mother. "I don't want to think about that." "Uncle Clarence said I'll be driving in two years, with my learner's permit." Janelle glared at her brother, who ducked his head, hiding a grin. She turned back to Carmelita. "Remember what we always say, m'hija. Cars are weapons. You have to be very careful with them. And two years is a very long time." She shot another look at Clarence, her brows furrowed. He raised his hands to his older sister in defense. "I was just chatting her up. She's getting to be a big girl." He assumed a pronounced Latino accent. "Like it or not, hermana, two years from now your daughter's gonna have a steering wheel in her hands. She's gonna be one weaponized young lady." When the furrow between Janelle's brows deepened, Clarence lifted his hands further, his palms out. "Just talking the truth to you." He hoisted his shoulders close to his ears in an exaggerated shrug, his lips pooched out. "What can I say?" Janelle turned her back on her brother, crossing her arms in front of her. "Carm was a natural up there just now," Chuck told her. She shifted her elbows, loosening her folded arms. "Do they actually have a kids' section?" "Maybe. Either way, though, I'd say she should enter the open division. The way she climbed that tower just now, you never know." Carmelita's face glowed pink beneath her cafe au lait complexion, but Janelle pursed her lips. "You mean, where she'd be going up against anybody and everybody?" "All the other female climbers, anyway." "But that was the first time she's ever climbed anything in her whole life. You just got her the helmet and climbing shoes last week." Chuck glanced at the tower. "This is why we got them for her. Besides, I don't think she'd have any chance of winning. Although I will say, climbing isn't as much about experience and repetitive practice as other sports. It's a matter of natural body control and sense of balance&#x2014;which, clearly, Carm's got by the bucketful. From what I just saw, I don't think she'd have anything to be ashamed of." Carmelita beamed up at him. "Really?" Chuck cupped the back of her head in his hand and looked into her luminous, almond eyes. "Really." "Cool," Rosie declared. She jigged at her sister's side, her arms swinging. "You should do it for sure, Carm." Janelle rested her hand over Chuck's at the back of Carmelita's head. "You really think you want to try it?" Carmelita nodded, bouncing up and down on her toes. "You won't be sad when you lose?" "If she loses," Chuck said. "No," Carmelita told her mother. "I won't. I promise." Rosie chimed in, "But I'll be sad for her. Would that be okay, Mama?" The corners of Janelle's mouth ticked upward and her face softened. "Okay," she said. "You guys win." At the base of the tower, Jimmy tied a re-woven figure eight into the end of the climbing rope with a well practiced flip of his fingers. He clipped the loop into his harness. Still exchanging small talk with Bernard, he gave the rope a tug, assuring it ran from his waist, up through the pulley at the top of the tower, and back down to the auto-belay mechanism. Faded tattoos purpled Jimmy's sinewy forearms below the short sleeves of his plaid, cotton shirt. A long, braided beard, cinnamon going silver, curved outward from his jaw like a scorpion's tail. Stringy, gray-streaked red hair fell to his shoulders from the back of the battered straw cowboy hat he wore low over his brow like a country singer. His loose, faded blue jeans clung to his narrow waist, and the top buttons of his shirt were undone, revealing a red bandanna&#x2014;his signature style statement for as long as Chuck had known him&#x2014;knotted around his neck. "Show us what you can do, Jimmy," Chuck called to him. "You're the man," Bernard cheered from behind the line of boulders. He tapped the sides of his legs with his hands, a quick rat-a-tat beat. "Let's see how much gas you've got left in the old tank." Bernard's pasty face and jowly cheeks spoke of his current life as an office-bound attorney for a downtown San Francisco law firm, as did his high fashion, turquoise-framed glasses. His ample waistline pressed at his pleated khaki shorts and short-sleeved dress shirt, while his closely cropped brown hair showed only a hint of gray. He turned to Carmelita. "And you're the climbing-est girl of them all," he congratulated her. He continued to tap his legs with his hands and counted off in time with the taps, "One...two...three, four, five. You're the girl who's got the jive." Jimmy settled his hands on two holds above his head. "You guys are next," he said over his shoulder to Chuck and Bernard. "Not me," Chuck said. "No way." "I'm ground-based these days," said Bernard. "You're scared you can't do it anymore," Jimmy said. "You got that right," the two of them said together. Jimmy tightened his grip on the holds at the base of the climbing tower and lifted himself off the ground. He ascended the large, easy-to-grasp holds on the lower portion of the tower with no apparent strain, the belay mechanism automatically taking up the slack in the rope as he climbed. Each of his moves was precise, his fingers set, his feet poised on holds beneath him. He angled left and right, scaling the wall with ease, his decades of climbing experience evident. He passed the halfway point on the tower and reached above his head for a small hold thirty feet off the ground. Only two of his fingertips fit atop the tiny protrusion, which sloped outward, providing little purchase. He grunted as he transferred his weight to the hold, revealing his first sign of strain. His knuckles turned white as he clung to the tower. Then his fingertips slipped from the hold and he fell.

A half-century later, they're still trying to make sense of what they saw.</p><p>Carrying to the plate baseball's heaviest and loudest bat as well as the burden of being the club's first African American superstar, Allen found both hits and controversy with ease and regularity as he established himself as the premier individualist in a game that prided itself on conformity. As one of his managers observed, "I believe God Almighty hisself would have trouble handling Richie Allen." A brutal pregame fight with teammate Frank Thomas, a dogged determination to be compensated on par with the game's elite, an insistence on living life on his own terms and not management's: what did it all mean? Journalists and fans alike took sides with ferocity, and they take sides still.</p><p>Despite talent that earned him Rookie of the Year and MVP honors as well as a reputation as one of his era's most feared power hitters, many remember Allen as one of the game's most destructive and divisive forces, while supporters insist that he is the best player not in the Hall of Fame. <i>God Almighty Hisself: The Life and Legacy of Dick Allen</i> explains why.</p><p>Mitchell Nathanson presents Allen's life against the backdrop of organized baseball's continuing desegregation process. Drawing out the larger generational and business shifts in the game, he shows how Allen's career exposed not only the racial double standard that had become entrenched in the wake of the game's integration a generation earlier but also the forces that were bent on preserving the status quo. In the process, <i>God Almighty Hisself</i> unveils the strange and maddening career of a man who somehow managed to fulfill and frustrate expectations all at once.</p></p><p>Mitchell Nathanson is Professor of Law at Villanova University School of Law. He is author of A People&#39;s History of Baseball and coauthor of Understanding Baseball: A Textbook.<p>Prologue<br>Baseball's Way</p><p>"I wouldn't say that I hate Whitey, but deep down in my heart, I just can't stand Whitey's ways, man." Dick Allen, in repose, at last, with a reporter of all people, spoke freely and held nothing back. A confluence of factors unburdened him for what seemed like the first time in years, maybe the first time ever, or at least since anybody outside of Wampum, Pennsylvania, had become aware of the bespectacled Superman with the seemingly never-ending litany of first names (Dick? Rich? Richie? Sleepy?). He was finally rid of both Philadelphia and the Phillies after six-plus years of torment on both sides of the equation, having settled tranquilly (although not wholly without incident) in St. Louis with the Cardinals, an organization known as much for its acceptance of its black ballplayers as its on-field success. He was now just one of the guys on a team replete with future Hall of Famers, such as Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, and Steve Carlton, and no longer the athletic fulcrum of an entire city. And he was rapping with a member of the black media for a change&#x2014;speaking with someone who perhaps was more likely to understand who he was and where had been&#x2014;someone who knew what it took to have to deal with those who assumed that the issue of equality had been solved years before with the abolition of "separate but equal" and the segregated lunch counters and water fountains that went with it. For a moment at least, Dick Allen was at peace.</p><p>The <i>Ebony</i> reporter tried to get it all down as Allen went on: "I get to reading those novels and things and get right mad." Here now a revelation&#x2014;Dick Allen, the man reviled by so many in Philadelphia, the man thought by so many in the stands as well as a share of the media to be witless and clueless, saw truth in fiction, saw himself and all that he had been subjected to, in the characters and progression of a novel. "I just got through reading&#x2014;what was it&#x2014;[<i>The</i>] <i>Greengage Affair</i>, I think it was, about the life of a black cat who lived in Mississippi." Written by Linda Du Breuil, who would later be known as the Queen of Pornography for such sex-soaked paperbacks as <i>The Teeny-Boffer</i>, <i>Peter Powers</i>, and <i>Sex on St. James Street</i> (written under one of her many noms de plume, D. Barry Linder), <i>The Greengage Affair</i> was something else altogether&#x2014;outside of a solitary (albeit simmering) sex scene, a meditation on race relations in both the Deep South as well as the supposedly more enlightened North.</p><p>Chronicling the emergence of black consciousness in Lex Morrow, the novel's protagonist, <i>The Greengage Affair</i> resonated with Dick for its asides on the ugly truth of contemporary race relations, be they in the backwater of the fictional Greengage, Mississippi, the real-world Little Rock, Arkansas, where Dick endured a minor league trial by fire in 1963, or the large, allegedly progressive northern cities such as Detroit or even Philadelphia. "It's a good book," Allen continued, sharing a thought that would no doubt get lost, get jumbled, get misconstrued by a different audience, "but, you see, all this type of stuff makes me mad. And then I'm really aware of Whitey, man, really aware of Whitey. Philly taught me that people can be the cruelest things in the world." Philly wasn't Little Rock, but as Lex's father explained in <i>The Greengage Affair</i>, that wasn't saying all that much if you really thought about it: "Sure, they ain't no signs up in the rest rooms, ain't no WHITE LADIES tacked on the restroom door and COLORED WOMEN on the others but . . . they don't <i>need</i> signs up here. We got Negro juke joints and Negro restaurants and Negro churches and Negro schools. Ain't a bit of difference. Not when you get right down to the gritty end, they ain't."</p><p>"In Philly," Dick remarked, "white barbers won't even let you in their shops, and [then] whites were hollering from the stands, 'Get your hair cut!'" Confusion and mixed messages seemingly reigned throughout his tenure in the city, but eventually Dick became resigned to it: "Even if they gave me an opportunity to tell all of my side of the story, I wouldn't take it because I just don't trust the white press in general. There may be some exceptions, but I don't trust the white press in general." And so he took a different path, one he saw reflected in <i>The Greengage Affair</i>. As Lex Morrow put it, "there's a difference between [simply] wanting to get out of something and refusing to participate." A subtle, yet strongly defiant message is sent when the former route&#x2014;perhaps the easier, clearer route&#x2014;is forsaken for the latter. Something is said through the mere act of refusal that cannot be uttered otherwise, something that brings a measure of dignity to what might otherwise be a situation devoid of any. And so Dick Allen refused to participate, first in little ways and then in greater ones. And a message was delivered. And a message was, ultimately, received.</p><p>Through the course of his major league career, Dick Allen was without doubt recognized for doing a lot of things. He was the 1964 National League Rookie of the Year and the 1972 American League Most Valuable Player. His 351 home runs are more than those of Hall of Famer Ron Santo and trail those of Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda by only 28 despite the fact that he accumulated nearly 1,400 fewer plate appearances than Cepeda. His three slugging titles dwarf the lone title claimed by the prototypical slugger of the era, Harmon Killebrew, and his lifetime .292 batting average tops Killebrew's by 36 points. And for those who pray to the altar of sabermetrics, his "adjusted OPS+" is higher than that of the greatest slugger of all time, Hall of Famer Hank Aaron. Because of all that he did, the MLB Network in 2012 ranked him as a member of its "Top Ten Not in the Hall of Fame" (he placed ninth). However, despite all that he did, Dick Allen is remembered more often for the myriad ways he refused to participate: in pregame batting and fielding practice most obviously, but in other ways more subtly. He refused to pander to the media, refused to accept management's time-honored methods for determining the value of a ballplayer, and, most explosively, refused to go along with and kowtow to the racial double standard that had evolved within Major League Baseball in the wake of the game's integration in 1947.</p><p>Because of all that he did as well as all that he refused to do, Dick became one of the most controversial players in the history of a game replete with them. As <i>Sports Illustrated</i> summed him up in 1970, "He is known as a man who hits a baseball even harder than he hits the bottle. . . . Allen shakes the game's Establishment and stirs up its followers as no other player can." Accordingly, nearly every baseball fan with an opinion had a strong one when it came to Dick Allen and today, many still do.</p><p>Throughout the arc of his productive yet strange and oftentimes maddening career, and in the decades thereafter, the debate over who was ultimately to blame for the controversy that seemingly followed him wherever he went raged on, and rages still. Was Dick the cause of his problems or merely misunderstood? Were they contrived by a media and fan base that resented what was perceived as his assertion of Black Power, or were they grounded in and simply the inevitable fallout from a player who just refused to be a team player in the most basic sense of the term? Who is responsible for the tragedy that was Dick Allen? For all of his talent, and despite how much his teammates seemed to like him wherever he went, who is to blame for the fact that no matter where his travels took him over the arc of his fifteen-year career&#x2014;Philadelphia, St. Louis, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia again, and Oakland&#x2014;disharmony, dissension, disagreement, and disruption invariably came along for the ride? Why is it that one of the most talented players of his generation was ranked by the preeminent baseball historian Bill James as not only the second most controversial player in baseball history (behind only Rogers Hornsby, an accused wife-beater, inveterate gambler, and all-around deadbeat who was continually dragged into court for his failure to pay his taxes and other debts) but someone who "did more to <i>keep</i> his teams from winning than anybody else who ever played major league baseball"? Good questions all.</p><p>Unfortunately, much of the reason why these questions have never been satisfactorily answered is because they're the wrong ones. Instead, the foundational question raised by Dick Allen's mercurial career is this: Why wasn't a black superstar such as Dick, as difficult as he could be at times, accorded the same deference by the working press and fan base as were the white superstars of his era? Unquestionably, Dick both expected and demanded treatment that was not accorded to his teammates, but in so doing he was not alone; for decades, temperamental baseball superstars such as Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, and others made similar demands, and, more often than not, their demands were met by a compliant media and public that were more than willing to ignore or explain away transgressions and repeated instances of bad behavior in their zeal to immortalize and purify their heroes. Despite the newly ravenous media that emerged in the 1960s, this pattern persisted, with players such as Mickey Mantle and Carl Yastrzemski likewise reaping the benefits of the game's treatment of its luminaries irrespective of their personal foibles.</p><p>But with Dick Allen things were different. Yearning to be the beneficiary of the hallowed double standard accorded to the game's superstar elite, Dick found himself instead the victim of another double standard, one that enforced a code of conduct upon the game's black players, even black superstars, that was neither required nor expected of similarly situated white ones. This he could not fathom; this he could not countenance. And so he rebelled&#x2014;not by yelling and stomping his feet but quietly, by simply refusing to go along with it all. And the game would never be the same.</p><p>For all of the ink spilled over the triumphant victory that was Jackie Robinson and the twentieth-century integration of Organized Baseball, there was a wave of black players that followed the pioneering Robinson and his cohorts&#x2014;Larry Doby, Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, and so on&#x2014;that began to infiltrate the game in the late 1950s, just as the Negro Leagues' short tenure as a de facto minor league was coming to an end. This generation negotiated a harrowing minor league gauntlet of segregated southern cities and towns on their path to The Show, where they would emerge not as symbols of racial progress, living monuments to the power of change, but merely as ballplayers, no different than the white ones playing alongside them. No different but yet oftentimes, in countless subtle ways, subjected to differing treatment nonetheless.</p><p>This second generation of black players has received much less attention than Jackie Robinson's perhaps because their stories are less obviously triumphant, less clearly symbolic of <i>something</i>. This was Dick Allen's generation and their stories are, in fact, no less compelling, no less triumphant. But this generation, unlike Robinson's, did not end with an exclamation mark. Instead it bled slowly and imperceptibly into the modern game, where the racial double standard finally disappeared, and if you don't look for it, you're likely to miss it. But it's there. And Dick Allen, at times unwittingly, at times quite cunningly, is a large part of the reason it ultimately succeeded.</p><p>In a way, Dick Allen's fight with baseball was like Robinson's&#x2014;a fight for equality. But whereas Jackie's fight was simply for the right to play on the same field as equally talented white players, Dick's was to be accorded the same respect and deference as his white peers. Thanks to Jackie Robinson and his first-wave contemporaries, Dick was able to take the field under the assumption that he had just as much of a right to be there as anyone else, but he extended the battle into its logical next phase: the fight for equal treatment among the equally talented. He would accept nothing short of this and, eventually, baseball, its fans, and its attendant media would see things his way but not without a succession of clashes that would consume virtually his entire career. For as Dick surveyed the baseball landscape, he saw not that fans and the media were unable to appreciate and applaud black superstars; many within the first wave were rightly lauded and repeatedly so. Rather, he saw that those who expected white praise were in exchange expected to sublimate their anger just as Robinson was famously instructed by Dodgers president Branch Rickey to do, or simply not talk about the death threats, the ugliness of their minor league experiences, the callowness they were subjected to both as blacks and as ballplayers. "Richie Allen wants to be treated like Willie Mays so bad he can taste it," asserted Gene Mauch, his inaugural manager in Philadelphia. "But so far he's still trying to find out how to act like Willie Mays." Dick realized very early on, however, that he was unable to abide as his predecessors had done. And he paid the price for this.</p><p>What follows is an examination of Dick Allen's baseball life and career with an eye toward explaining not only how one of the greatest natural talents in baseball history both fulfilled and frustrated expectations all at once but how he compelled fans, the media, and baseball itself to confront at last the racial double standard that had become entrenched in the wake of the game's integration a generation earlier. Herein also lies an attempt to clarify the walking dichotomy that was Dick Allen, a man who was introverted in the extreme but who spoke out frequently nonetheless, a man who routinely hid from the media but who was described by Roy Blount Jr. in 1973 as "the first black man, and indeed the only contemporary man of any color, to assert himself in baseball with something like the unaccommodating force of Muhammad Ali in boxing, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in basketball and Jim Brown in football." A man who was dismissed by even his staunchest supporters as inarticulate and confused who nevertheless sized up the inherent inequalities present in the contract negotiating process as it was then routinely conducted and became one of the first players of any color to successfully insert his agent into the deliberations: "The owner, he goes out and gets himself a qualified man to negotiate for him. He sends his man with all his experience or all his degrees to negotiate with me. Me? I've got 12 years of schooling. So, me, I get my lawyer. The first man, he's the owner's protection. The lawyer, well, he's mine. I mean the word is <i>negotiate</i>, isn't it? All right, so let's do that. Let's negotiate. But let's try to keep the sides even." In so doing, this seemingly inarticulate and confused man eventually managed to make himself the game's highest-paid player of the pre-free agency era.</p><p>But he never confused being rich with being free. To Dick, being rich wasn't the point. In fact, it was nowhere near the point. All the money in the world couldn't buy a man his dignity, and he wouldn't sacrifice his for anything. Although he l...</p></p><h2>The Quiet Side of Passion: An Isabel Dalhousie Novel (12) (Isabel Dalhousie Series)</h2><p>As a full-time mother, wife, and editor, Isabel barely has any time for herself.

His works have been translated into more than forty languages and have been best sellers throughout the world. He lives in Scotland.&#x2018;Gossip?&#x2019; asked Isabel Dalhousie, philosopher, wife, mother, and editor of the <i>Review of Applied Ethics</i>. With the first three of these roles she was unreservedly happy; the editorship, though, she would at times gladly have passed on to somebody else&#x2014;at particularly stressful moments to anybody at all&#x2014;except that there was nobody to take it on, or at least no one who would do it unpaid, without complaint, and with the enthusiasm and wit that Isabel devoted to it. All of which seemed to suggest that Isabel was the editor of the <i>Review of Applied Ethics </i>for life.<br>&nbsp;<br>She was sitting in the kitchen of her house in Edinburgh, a glass of chilled white wine on the table before her. It was a warm evening, at least by the standards applied in Scotland, where summer is sometimes no more than a promise, an aspiration. On the side of the glass small beads of condensation had appeared, some of which were now becoming tiny rivulets, hesitant at first but growing in confidence. Isabel had a tendency to get lost in her musings, and now the thought came to her that this was the way in which all rivers started: a single drop of water somewhere joined up with another and became something altogether more significant; as with the Ganges, for instance, from whose banks people still bathed in the hope of spiritual gain, indifferent to the coliform load of each drop of that lethal water. Or the Limpopo, the river so alliteratively described by Kipling as great, grey-green, and greasy, all set about with fever trees&#x2014;though apparently it was not like that at all, she had been told by a friend who had actually seen it. &#x2018;The Limpopo was somewhat sluggish,&#x2019; her friend had said. &#x2018;There was no sign of grease, and it was more brown than green.&#x2019; But that was not the issue: what interested her was the observation that a large river starts with a tiny drop. There was a tipping point, it seemed, for everything: fame, fads, political careers&#x2014;and water.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the other side of the kitchen, paging through a recipe book, undecided as yet as to what to cook for dinner that night, was her husband, Jamie: bassoonist, father, occasional composer, incidental tennis player, and in the view of virtually every woman who ever met him, the perfect man. That last encomium was one Isabel herself readily would have bestowed, but only after a third or fourth meeting. When they&#x2019;d first met, Isabel had been recovering from an uncomfortable divorce and was still wary of her ability to judge men. Some years earlier she had taken up with John Liamor, an Irishman she had met in Cambridge and whom she had then married, to the dismay of her father and just about all of her friends. They had seen what she had not, and over the next few years she learned what it was that she had missed.<br>&nbsp;<br>There had been another reason why Isabel might have been cautious of Jamie on first meeting: at that time he happened to be the boyfriend of Isabel&#x2019;s niece, Cat, owner of a delicatessen a short walk from Isabel&#x2019;s house. They may have been aunt and niece, but the age gap between Isabel and Cat was small enough for them sometimes to be taken for sisters. But there were limits to such sisterhood as existed between them, as they were very different characters. Both were sociable, but Cat was rather inclined to fall for people&#x2014;particularly men&#x2014;before she had any real chance of getting to know them properly. This meant that her boyfriends&#x2014;of whom there had been a steady succession&#x2014;tended to be chosen without adequate attention to compatibility. She liked handsome men, and also seemed to cultivate men about whom there was a slight whiff of danger. Isabel was far more cautious in her friendships, and tended to show a certain reticence before she opened up to a new acquaintance. Cat could at times be a bit moody, whereas Isabel usually made an effort to keep bleak feelings to herself. Cat was decisive&#x2014;a useful quality when running a small business&#x2014;whereas Isabel was inclined to worry about the pros and cons of any particular action. Isabel reflected on things before she acted; Cat acted and then&#x2014;sometimes, but not always&#x2014;reflected on what she had done. Isabel took the view that if one made a mistake, one should be careful not to make it again. Cat&#x2019;s view of any mistakes she made was to regard them as water under the bridge and to move on as cheerfully as possible. Sometimes, of course, that meant she moved on to the next mistake rather than anywhere else.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cat&#x2019;s life, then, was not an example of the examined life of which philosophers have long written; Isabel&#x2019;s life, by contrast, was a life lived under a moral microscope. In their different ways, both these approaches worked for the two women. Both were happy with their lot; each felt that the other had the wrong approach to things, but tolerated the contrast. Sometimes, though, matters became fraught, and the relationship was tested in an uncomfortable way. That had happened with Jamie, Cat&#x2019;s former boyfriend, and now Isabel&#x2019;s husband.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Isabel was introduced to Jamie, she imagined that he must be just one more of Cat&#x2019;s unsuitable boyfriends&#x2014;as unreliable as he was good-looking. She was wrong; Jamie was quite unlike any of Cat&#x2019;s previous men and it was perhaps for this reason that she ended her affair with him after they had been together for little more than a few months. Jamie, it seemed, was not what Cat was looking for. He was simply too safe. Not that Jamie was ever dull&#x2014;far from it&#x2014;but if you were somebody like Cat, looking for a man who had just a touch of <i>wildness </i>about him, then Jamie was not that. Jamie was decent&#x2014;&#x2018;heart-meltingly decent&#x2019;, as one of Isabel&#x2019;s friends had once described him. &#x2018;And dishy,&#x2019; the same friend had added, &#x2018;knee-weakeningly dishy&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>After Cat had broken up with him, Isabel had continued to see Jamie, whom she had considered a friend. This friendship had in due course become something more, and Isabel and Jamie became lovers, and eventually spouses. Not surprisingly, Cat took this badly&#x2014;with a complete lack of grace, in fact: no niece expects her cast-offs to be taken on by her aunt, and there ensued a period of chilled relations between the two women. The birth of Isabel&#x2019;s son, Charlie, had made matters even worse, although eventually a thaw set in and Cat accepted the existence of Charlie&#x2014;huffs can be demanding, even to the huffiest. What was more, Cat needed Isabel&#x2019;s help in running her delicatessen and now Isabel regularly, and generously, provided cover over busy periods or when Cat was short-staffed.<br>&nbsp;<br>As for Jamie, willingness to cook was one of the qualities that made him the perfect man. He was versatile in his approach, perhaps a bit more adventurous than Isabel, and he had a particular appetite for vintage cookery books of which he had built up quite a collection. That evening he had extracted a first edition of Julia Childs&#x2014;signed by Julia herself to one of Isabel&#x2019;s American aunts in Mobile, Alabama, and passed on years earlier as a special birthday present. He was planning a chicken dish, and was taking an inventory of ingredients before he embarked on the recipe.<br>&nbsp;<br>They were by themselves, enjoying that blissful period of calm so familiar to parents when the children have been put to bed, the scattered toys rounded up and put away, and quiet reigns in the house. Both Charlie and his younger brother Magnus were now asleep, each broadcasting, from their separate monitors, a reassuring sound of breathing, punctuated by occasional snuffles, into the kitchen. Charlie had taken some time to settle, insisting on the re-reading of a book that Isabel had found in the Morningside Library. She rather wished she had left the book there on the library shelf; there was a tiger in this book, and he had no discernible redeeming qualities. He was fortunate, she felt, to avoid the fate of the tigers she remembered from her own childhood reading of a book now suppressed for reasons unconnected with tigers, but that had entailed the transformation of encircling tigers into ghee, Indian butter. As a small girl she had loved that ending, and had imagined that the fate of being turned into butter might be extended to other threatening creatures or even people. In fact, one might even have a &#x2018;butter list&#x2019; of such persons who, even if they saw their names on it, would be unaware of what it entailed. Having an enemies list was too overt, as more than one politician has discovered: the existence of an enemies list could be embarrassing if it fell into the hands of the press&#x2014;or <i>a fortiori </i>into those of the enemies it listed; a butter list, by contrast, would attract no adverse attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie looked up from his recipe book. &#x2018;Gossip?</p><h2>The Math of Astrology</h2><p>The Math of Astrology is a simple, methodical, step-by-step guide for manual chart calculation with pencil and paper. Often perceived as difficult, chart calculation is in fact a skill easily mastered with practice. Basic arithmetic is used with each formula to determine sidereal time, planetary positions, and house cusps. Manual chart calculation offers an extra benefit: the process leads to a deeper understanding and interpretation of the chart, which comes alive as each step in erecting the chart is completed. In addition to learning how to manually calculate a natal chart, the authors also present step-by-step instructions for calculating the secondary progressed chart, secondary progressed angles, and the Part of Fortune and Part of Spirit. You will also learn how to calculate secondary progressions for a specific date and time, as well as return charts (solar, lunar, and planetary), relocated charts, declinations, aspects, and midpoints. There is also a helpful chapter devoted to detecting and correcting errors in chart calculation, and worksheets that can be photocopied and used during each step, from natal to progressed to return chart. Also included is a chapter on the basics of natal chart interpretation, and another that offers interpretation guidelines for the progressed chart. The latter introduces the concept of cycles, the value of progressions in forecasting, delineation of the progressed Moon through the houses, and delineation of aspects made by the progressed Sun.</p><p></p><h2>The Rescue (Ryan Decker, 1)</h2><p><p><b>An Amazon Charts and <i>Washington Post</i> bestseller.</b></p><p><b>For fans of Tom Clancy and Lee Child, a heart-pumping thriller of betrayal, revenge, and conspiracy by <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author Steven Konkoly.</b></p><p>Former CIA operative turned mercenary for hire Ryan Decker&#x2019;s specialty is rescuing kidnap victims.

I mean one whole month of 2011 has disappeared, it&#x2019;s gone, it can&#x2019;t be found. Normally February follows January, March follows February, April follows March, and so on. But now after January it&#x2019;s March, or after February it&#x2019;s April . . . Do you understand what I&#x2019;m saying&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve skipped a month!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fang Caodi, just forget it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go looking for it. It&#x2019;s not worth it. Life&#x2019;s too short; just look after yourself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter how clever I was, I could never change Fang Caodi. Then again, if you really wanted to search for a missing month, Fang Caodi would be the one to do it. In his life, he&#x2019;d probably spent quite a few missing months just existing. He was always turning up unexpectedly in odd places like he had vanished for a million years and was being reborn just when you were least expecting him. Maybe someone like him really could accomplish such a politically unfashionable task as restoring a missing month.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing is, at first I didn&#x2019;t really notice that a whole month was missing. Even if other people told me about it, I wasn&#x2019;t ready to believe them. Every day I read the papers and checked the Internet news sites; every night I watched CCTV and the Phoenix Channel, and I hung around with intelligent people. I didn&#x2019;t think that any major event had escaped my notice. I believed in myself&#x2014;my knowledge, my wisdom, and my independent judgment.<br>&nbsp;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the afternoon of the eighth day of the first lunar month of this year, as I left my home in Happiness Village Number Two and set out on my usual walk to the Starbucks in the PCCW Tower Mall of Plenty, a jogger suddenly pulled up in front of me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Master Chen! Master Chen!&#x201d; the jogger gasped while trying to regain his breath. &#x201c;A whole month is missing! It&#x2019;s been missing for two years today.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jogger was wearing a baseball cap, and I didn&#x2019;t recognize him at first.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fang Caodi, Fang Caodi . . .&#x201d; he said as he took off his cap to reveal a bald head sporting a short ponytail held at the back with a rubber band.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, I knew who it was. &#x201c;Fang Caodi. Why are you calling me master?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ignored me. &#x201c;A whole month is missing! Master Chen, what can we do about it, what can we do?&#x201d; he repeated rather desperately. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been more than a month since we last met, hasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Longer than that. Master Chen, you know, a whole month has disappeared! It&#x2019;s terrifying. What should we do about it?&#x201d; Fang said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to change the subject. &#x201c;When did you get back to Beijing?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn&#x2019;t answer and then suddenly he sneezed. I handed him my card. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t catch cold. You shouldn&#x2019;t be running around. We can meet later. My phone number and e-mail are on the card.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put his cap back on and took my card. &#x201c;We can look for it together,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I watched him jog off toward the Dongzhi Menwai Embassy Row area, I realized he wasn&#x2019;t just out for a jog, he was on a mission.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Another person not seen in a long time</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of days later, I found myself attending the <i>Reading Journal </i>New Year&#x2019;s reception &nbsp;on the second floor of the Sanlian Bookstore on Art Museum East Road. The reception was an annual affair. In the 1990s I used to drop in off and on, but since I moved to Beijing permanently in 2004, I&#x2019;ve come up every other year to shoot the breeze a while with the older writers and editors, just to let the cultural world know that I&#x2019;m still alive. I never bother with the younger ones&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know them and they don&#x2019;t seem to feel any need to know me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere at the reception was somehow different from previous years; the guests seemed quite elated. For the past year, I&#x2019;ve noticed that I, too, have often felt some sort of unaccountable cheerfulness, but the high spirits that day still took me aback. That day everybody was so euphoric it was as if they&#x2019;d just knocked back a few shots of Jack Daniel&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The venerable founder of&nbsp;<i>Reading, </i>Zhuang&nbsp;Zizhong, hadn&#x2019;t made&nbsp;an appearance at&nbsp;a reception for a while, but &nbsp;this time he turned up in his wheelchair. There was quite a crowd jostling around him, so I didn&#x2019;t go over to say hello. Besides Old Zhuang, all the staff at the journal&#x2014;those who were still alive, that is&#x2014;had all showed up. That was no minor miracle. In all the years I&#x2019;ve been associated with the Sanlian and its journal, <i>Reading, </i>I&#x2019;ve never seen such a grand occasion.&nbsp;It left me pleasantly surprised. I&#x2019;m quite cynical about human nature. I&#x2019;ve never believed that the inner workings of any organization were completely harmonious, especially not any mainland-Chinese organization, and particularly not state-operated enterprises, including state-operated cultural units.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day all the writers and editors whom I knew greeted me with excessive enthusiasm; but when I started to strike up a proper conversation, their attention had already shifted and they hurried off to someone else. This sort of treatment is pretty common at receptions and cocktail parties, especially when you&#x2019;re not a star. After being greeted and then snubbed two or three times, I readjusted my attitude and returned to my usual one&#x2014;that of an observer. I have to admit I was pretty moved by what I saw: so many celebrated &nbsp;and diverse members &nbsp;of the &nbsp;intellectual &nbsp;elite gathered &nbsp;together&nbsp;in one place looking genuinely happy, even euphoric . . . This really must be a true age of peace and prosperity, I thought to myself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was feeling pretty good, but very quickly I got the feeling that it was time to leave. I walked out of the reception intending to browse around in the bookstore. I took a look at the art books on the second floor, and then glanced at the new bestsellers and the business and travel books on the first floor. The bookstore was teeming with browsers. So people are still reading books. Terrific! &#x201c;The sweet smell of books in a literary society,&#x201d; I thought. As I made my way downstairs toward the basement, students were crowding both sides of the stairs, sitting and reading, almost as though they didn&#x2019;t want anyone else to go down there. Feeling cheerful, I picked my way down the stairs. The basement level is where &nbsp;the Sanlian keeps its extensive collection of books on literature, history, philosophy, politics, and the humanities, and that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s my number-one destination every time I visit. I&#x2019;ve always believed that the generous display of these humanities books is one of the things that make Beijing a city worth living in. A city that reads books on literature, history, philosophy, and politics is definitely a special place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basement level was very quiet that day. No one was around, and strangely enough, when I got down there I didn&#x2019;t really feel like browsing anymore. I just wanted to lay my hands on one particular book, but I couldn&#x2019;t remember what it was. I walked into the room thinking that when I saw it I would know. As I walked past the philosophy section and moved on to the politics and history sections, I suddenly felt I couldn&#x2019;t breathe. Was the basement air that bad?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I decided to make a quick exit. I was walking up the stairs trying not to bump into any of the youngsters, when suddenly somebody grabbed the cuff of my trousers. I looked down in surprise, and that person looked up at me. It was not one of the young people.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Lao Chen!&#x201d; She seemed surprised to see me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Little Xi&#x201d; is all I said, but I was thinking, Little Xi, where have you been all these years?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I saw you go downstairs and I thought, that must be Lao Chen!&#x201d; From the way she said it she seemed to imply that running into me was quite important.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you go up to the reception?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No . . . I didn&#x2019;t know about it till I got here. Are you free now?&#x201d; She leaned toward me conspiratorially.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll buy you a cup of coffee.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused a minute before she said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just walk and talk.&#x201d; Then she let go of my trouser leg.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started strolling toward the National Art Museum. I walked beside her, waiting for her to start a conversation, but she didn&#x2019;t, so I asked her about her mother. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Big Sister Song?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She must be over eighty now?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And how&#x2019;s your son?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No answer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How old is he?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Over twenty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;That old?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yup.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is he at university or working?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s at university. Look,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;can we change the subject?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered how much she doted on her son and was startled at her reaction. &nbsp;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go to the Prime Hotel and have a cup of coffee,&#x201d; I offered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t want to, so we walked instead into the small park next to the National Art Museum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little Xi stopped suddenly. &#x201c;Lao Chen, have you noticed anything?&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&#x2019;t know how I should respond, but I knew I couldn&#x2019;t say, &#x201c;Noticed what?&#x201d; She seemed to be testing me. If I gave her the wrong answer, it was unlikely she&#x2019;d open up to me. As a writer, I like people to tell me their innermost thoughts. As a man, I wanted this woman to tell me her innermost thoughts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I paused, feeling a little awkward, and she asked, &#x201c;Is it kind of hard for you to express your feelings?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave a small nod. I&#x2019;ve often felt nothing at all when people have asked how I feel about a work of art or a piece of music. I hate this feeling of feeling nothing, but I&#x2019;m pretty good at faking an acceptable response.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s great, I knew it,&#x201d; she went on. &#x201c;When I saw you going down the stairs, I thought to myself, Lao Chen will understand. Then I sat there waiting for you to come back up the stairs.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Little Xi&#x2019;s mind I&#x2019;m probably a reasonable, mature, and fairly knowledgeable person.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d like people to think.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s sit down on this bench,&#x201d; I suggested gently.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to work, because after we sat down she relaxed, closed her eyes, sighed deeply, and said, &#x201c;At last.&#x201d;<br>Little Xi was definitely my type. After so many years, her looks and figure hadn&#x2019;t changed much, but wrinkles had begun to appear on her face from neglect. She also looked pretty depressed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She kept her eyes closed, trying to regain her composure. I looked at her intently and I suddenly realized how much I still liked this woman. I like melancholy women.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anyone to talk to. I feel like there &nbsp;are fewer and fewer people like us . . . There are so few of us left that life hardly seems worth living anymore.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s lonely, but no matter how lonely you are, life still goes on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She ignored my banal response. &#x201c;No one remembers, except me. No one talks about it, except me. Does that mean I&#x2019;m completely mad? There&#x2019;s no trace of it, no evidence, so nobody can be bothered.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was enjoying the sound of her Beijing accent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She briefly opened her eyes before closing them again. &#x201c;Well, how about it? We were such good friends. Why haven&#x2019;t I seen you for so many years? What happened?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d gone abroad.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shook her head. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s good that you didn&#x2019;t.

It was such a beautiful spring afternoon; the sun was so bright and warm that many elderly couples were strolling around the park. There were also a few smokers . . . smokers? Two of them were standing close by chain-smoking. I like to read detective stories and I&#x2019;ve even written a few myself, and so this situation left plenty of room for the imagination. It could have been a surveillance scene, but as I was nothing more than a self-indulgent writer of very ordinary bestsellers, why would anyone want to spy on me? Wherever there are people in China there are smokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I listened as Little Xi continued to pour her heart out to me. &#x201c;Am I causing trouble, making a fuss? I know it&#x2019;s none of my business, but I can&#x2019;t act just like nothing&#x2019;s happened. How can things change just like that?

Drawing on newly uncovered evidence, geographer and maritime historian Samuel Bawlf masterfully reconstructs Francis Drake&#x2019;s historic round-the-world expedition, exploring the drama surrounding the voyage and offering intriguing insights into life at sea in the sixteenth century. But it is Bawlf&#x2019;s assertion of Drake&#x2019;s whereabouts in the summer of 1579 that gives the book even greater originality: from an intensive study of maps of the period, Bawlf shows with certainty that Drake sailed all the way to Alaska&#x2014;much farther than anyone has heretofore imagined&#x2014;thereby rewriting the history of exploration in North America.</p><p><b>Samuel Bawlf </b>was a Canadian politican and author. In 1972 he was the youngest person ever elected to the Victoria City Council. He served on the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, as a member of the Social Credit Party, and as the minister of conservation and recreation. He was the author of <i>The Secret Journey of Sir Francis Drake</i>, published in 2003. He died in 2016.Maritime historian Bawlf skillfully uncovers new information regarding Drake's circumnavigation of the globe, which began, amidst political and religious upheaval in Europe, in 1577. Until now, Drake's secret voyage-the exploration of the Pacific Northwest in hopes of finding the fabled Northwest Passage to eastern trade routes, and to establish a British colony in the New World-was hidden under a "cloak of secrecy" due to Drake's complicated relationship with Queen Elizabeth and England's precarious political situation with Spain. With braided historical, nautical, geographical and imagined narrative elements, Drake's voyage unfolds slowly at first, and at times lags under the weight of all Bawlf attempts to include. But once underway, it becomes an increasingly compelling tale, as Drake earns his reputation as "one of the greatest mariners that sail[ed] the seas, both as a navigator and as a commander," feared by his enemies for the "alarming scope of his [pirating] success." The account is thoroughly researched and carefully plotted, but Bawlf's true accomplishment is his humanization of historical icon Drake, a demanding, unyielding captain and ruthless sacker of Spanish ships and colonies, while at the same time a man who was deeply religious, who treated his captives with courtesy and was eager to establish strong bonds with the indigenous people he encountered along his journey. In the end, what resonates most is Drake's disappointment at being denied public ownership of his most important discoveries. This sympathetic, thorough treatment adds greater dimension to an already celebrated life. 60 b&amp;w illus., 20 maps. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Storm Gourmet: A Guide to Creating Extraordinary Meals Without Electricity</h2><p>This book proves that, with a little planning and minimal effort, you can eat surprisingly well during power outages.

These images, coupled with Goodall's simple, conversational text ("I think we are all getting a bit weary after our day in the forest"), follow a single day in the Gombe jungle. Goodall parallels human and chimp behavior&#x2014;kissing, hugging, spending time with family&#x2014;to emphasize the similarities that we share and to illustrate her point that people need to learn from the life that surrounds them. The spread pairing photos of a young chimp and a boy using the same gestures is particularly heartwarming.

Its representative, Narada, is the embodiment of the enlightened sage who travels the universe spreading his sacred teachings. Unlike Jnana Yoga, the Yoga of Wisdom, the bhakti acolyte does not discriminate against material phenomena--for him, all phenomena are aspects of God. Within the context of Ananda, blissful love, the temporal is realized as the reflection of the eternal, and the soul is realized as the expression of God.</p><p>Bhakti yoga is often demeaned as a gross simplification of Hindu spiritualism, and sometimes for good reason. It needn't be, though, because bhakti devotionalism can also offer a rich fullness that permeates daily life. In this commentary on the <i>Narada Bhakti Sutras</i>, American yogi Prem Prakash explains that unlike other yogas, bhakti yoga does not involve special activities or heavy thinking. In appearance, bhakti comes off like the 20 minute workout of religions--easy, quick, and guaranteed to give results. But as its name suggests, more than anything bhakti requires devotion. In a page or two of comments on each of the 84 verses of the <i>Narada Bhakti Sutras</i>, Prakash examines the straightforward doctrines of devotionalism and the calm joy that results. For example, he outlines the four methods for developing devotion, which entail relinquishing all attachment to the external world, unceasing worship ("orienting our minds away from selfish preoccupations and toward unselfish, unceasing love), engaging the world with love and joy, and accepting the grace of God through the teachings of a loving guru. If bhakti doesn't appear so simple after all, just remember that the devotional practitioner "is the most simple of men, finding his natural place in the rhythm of life and gaily dancing." <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Prem Prakash has been a practicing yogi since 1979 and in 1990 received permission from Baba Hari Dass to teach traditional Ashtanga Yoga. He is the director of the Green Mountain School of Yoga.</p><h2>The Communist Manifesto: &amp; Selected Writings</h2><p><p>Designed to appeal to the book lover, the Macmillan Collector's Library is a series of beautifully bound pocket-sized gift editions of much loved classic titles.

In his powerful call to arms, Marx expounds his famous theory that class struggle is the real determinant of historical change. </p><p>Next in this volume comes his treatise, <i>Wages, Price and Profit</i>, written in 1865, which serves as an accessible introduction to the ideas which Marx went on to develop in <i>Capital</i>, his masterful, multi volume analysis of how the world was irreversibly changed by the industrial revolution. </p><p>This <i>Macmillan Collector&#x2019;s Library </i>edition contains the most salient extracts from his great work, selected and introduced by Hugh Griffith. </p><p>Whilst old-style Marxism is now dead and buried, today's conflicts within capitalism are as sharp as ever and Marx&#x2019;s brilliant, painstaking writings remain disturbingly relevant.</p></p><p>Karl Marx was born in the German city of Trier in 1818. He studied law in Bonn and Berlin at his father&#x2019;s insistence, but his true interests lay elsewhere and, in 1841, he received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Jena. For the next two years he wrote for radical left-wing newspapers before moving to Paris with his wife, Jenny; there he became a communist and met his lifelong friend and collaborator, Friedrich Engels. They published their revolutionary pamphlet, <i>The Communist Manifesto, </i>in 1848 and Marx moved to London a year later. He spent the rest of his life there - often in considerable poverty - while he wrote his magnum opus of political theory, <i>Das Kapital</i>.

Buddies Kevin and Ravi are spending the night at their friend Jack&#x2019;s house, and, as with all sleepovers, startling things seem to wait behind each corner. But that lion&#x2019;s roar is really just the dog barking, and that thump in the closet just a toy.

Guicciardini&#x2019;s cartoon illustrations give the lesson learning a zany edge, especially when the kids are imagining nonexistent monsters.

With equal attention to anonymous subjects cast in the street as to global celebrities including Kate Moss, Madonna, Monica Bellucci, Claudia Schiffer, and Naomi Campbell, the book showcases Rheims&#x2019;s particular interest in female fragility and strength, and of the magic encounter between model and artist which disrupts codes of so-called eroticism to build up a new image system for womanhood.</p></p><p>Patrick Remy has authored several publications and launched two book series, namely Fashion Images de Mode and Strip/Paradise/Desire/Sensation (Steidl).

She must lead the people of Sylum back to the Enclave and persuade the Protectorat to grant them refuge from the wasteland. In Gaia's absence, the Enclave has grown more cruel, more desperate to experiment on mothers from outside the wall, and now the stakes of cooperating or rebelling have never been higher. Is Gaia ready, as a leader, to sacrifice what&#x2015;or whom&#x2015;she loves most? <i>Promised </i>is the thrilling conclusion to Caragh O'Brien's Birthmarked Trilogy.</p><p><p>Since earning an MA in the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University, Caragh M. O'Brien has been a high school teacher, an author of romance novels, and now a novelist for teens. Her novels <i>Birthmarked </i>and <i>Prized</i> were named YALSA Best Fiction for Young Adults. <i>Birthmarked</i> was also a Junior Library Guild Selection and chosen for the ALA 2011 Amelia Bloomer List. She lives with her family and writes from her home in Connecticut.</p>CHAPTER 1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>exodus</i><br>GAIA NOTCHED HER ARROW and drew back the taut string of her bow.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;At this range, I can&#x2019;t miss, and I&#x2019;m aiming for your right kidney.&#x201d;<br>The spying nomad lay belly-down, with goggles pushed up and binoculars pointed down the cliff toward Gaia&#x2019;s clans. An old rifle was propped within easy reach. At Gaia&#x2019;s voice, the spy lowered the binoculars a centimeter.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Now slowly move away from the rifle,&#x201d; Gaia said.<br>Instead, the nomad rolled over, threw the binoculars at her, and grabbed for the rifle. Gaia released her arrow and dodged sideways. She reached to notch a second arrow even as the first one pierced the nomad&#x2019;s hand, knocking the rifle wide to bounce over the cliff into silence. Before the spy could recover, Gaia stepped down hard on the arrow to pin the skewered hand to the ground.<br>&#x201c;I said don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; Gaia said.<br>She aimed her arrow point-blank at the nomad&#x2019;s face, and saw for the first time that below the goggles, the features belonged to a young girl.<br>Startled, Gaia eased up and lifted her foot off the girl&#x2019;s hand. She wrenched a dagger from the girl&#x2019;s belt and shoved back away from her. A quick look over her shoulder showed Gaia they were alone on the ridge, which annoyed her to no end. Where were her scouts? Overhead, the sky was an effulgent canopy of pinks and oranges, but the wasteland was washed in the ashy shadows of dusk, making visibility sketchy at best. Gaia notched her arrow again, ready.<br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be out here alone,&#x201d; Gaia said. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your tribe?&#x201d;<br>The nomad girl curled over her wounded hand. Blood dripped red onto the rocks, and the feathers of the arrow blossomed like a pernicious flower out of the back of her hand.<br>&#x201c;Speak up, girl,&#x201d; Gaia said.<br>The nomad girl hunched up her shoulders instead, and cradled her pierced hand to her chest. Ringed with dirt from the circles of her goggles, her dark eyes glistened with pain. If Gaia didn&#x2019;t know the girl had just been armed, she&#x2019;d have thought she was the most vulnerable, helpless-looking thing she&#x2019;d ever seen.<br>&#x201c;Are you understanding me?&#x201d; Gaia asked.<br>The girl still didn&#x2019;t reply, but from her alertness and the way she&#x2019;d initially responded, Gaia was convinced she did understand.<br>Gaia had a bad feeling about this. She scanned the ridge top again, peering around boulders through the brush and shadows. Sending a girl this young to spy implied that the girl&#x2019;s tribe was a bare-bones operation, but that didn&#x2019;t mean it wasn&#x2019;t dangerous. Down below, within easy range of a rifle shot, the nineteen clans of the caravan were setting up fires and cook pots, digging out their carefully rationed supplies of food. They had nothing extra to spare to raiders.<br>The girl couldn&#x2019;t be alone. Gaia noted critically that she was wrapped in layers of dusty cloth rather than sewn garments. Her worn boots looked like they&#x2019;d crossed long kilometers, and a red fringe around the ankles, evidence of loving craftsmanship, was now dark with dust. The girl turned startled eyes toward the brush, and in the same instant Gaia heard rustling. She crouched low, lifting her arrow again and pointing it at the girl.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; Gaia said, her voice low. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be the first one I shoot if someone gives me trouble.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mlass Gaia?&#x201d; came a low, familiar voice.<br>Relieved, Gaia straightened again and lowered her bow. Chardo Peter and five of her other scouts closed in on them, the women and men moving lightly over the rocks.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been looking for you,&#x201d; Peter said to Gaia. &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Gaia said. &#x201c;I expected forty scouts along this ridge. Where are they all?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Out further,&#x201d; Peter said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re moving inward now. Look.&#x201d;<br>Gaia glanced across to the next promontory and saw a hint of movement. Two scouts were highlighted briefly against the skyline before they shifted out of sight. Gaia slung her bow over her shoulder and put the arrow back in her quiver.<br>&#x201c;Warn them we&#x2019;re not alone. I want another full search of the perimeter, starting now,&#x201d; Gaia said, and a pair of scouts slipped into the shadows. Gaia stepped nearer to the girl, &#x201c;Who else is out there?&#x201d;<br>The girl, alarmed, shook her head.<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you talk?&#x201d; Gaia asked.<br>&#x201c;Need help,&#x201d; the girl said in a barely audible, guttural voice. She pointed to the west.<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s out there?&#x201d; Gaia pressed. &#x201c;Your family?&#x201d;<br>The girl shook her head again and conspicuously swallowed, working her throat. &#x201c;My friend is hurt,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br>Gaia stooped beside her. &#x201c;Let me see your hand,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Peter, look around for some binoculars. She threw them at me. And there&#x2019;s a rifle over the cliff. I want that retrieved.&#x201d;<br>Gaia reached for the girl&#x2019;s small hand, examining where the arrow shaft pierced her palm. The wound was ragged, and she couldn&#x2019;t staunch the bleeding until the shaft was removed. Gaia&#x2019;s stomach went light and queasy, but she focused, positioning the girl&#x2019;s hand on a wide, flat stone. She took a bandana out of her pocket and folded it in a square to be ready. Then she pulled out her knife.<br>&#x201c;Hold still,&#x201d; she said.<br>The girl watched her solemnly.<br>Gaia braced the arrow against the stone, cut sharply to sever off the tip end, and then leaned close to examine it for slivers. It was a clean, blunt cut.<br>&#x201c;I need your bandana, Peter,&#x201d; she said without looking at him. &#x201c;Fold it long on the diagonal, please.&#x201d; She met the girl&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pulling the arrow back through now. You ready?&#x201d;<br>The girl nodded, shutting her eyes tightly. Gaia pulled the arrow out with a slick sound, then held the girl&#x2019;s hand up high and packed her bandana into her palm.<br>&#x201c;Peter.&#x201d;<br>Peter passed her the makeshift bandage, and she secured his black bandana carefully around the girl&#x2019;s bloody hand. &#x201c;Keep it up here, by your neck, and apply pressure to both sides. See?&#x201d; she said, guiding the girl&#x2019;s other hand into place.<br>The girl opened her eyes and tentatively examined the arrangement.<br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s that feel?&#x201d; Gaia asked.<br>The girl nodded. She cleared her throat, but instead of speaking, she pointed west again and started getting to her feet.<br>&#x201c;It needs to be properly cleaned,&#x201d; Gaia said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you down to camp.&#x201d;<br>The girl shook her head and pulled at Gaia&#x2019;s sleeve, clearly indicating she wanted her to go with her away from camp.<br>&#x201c;Is your friend far?&#x201d; Gaia asked.<br>The girl raised five fingers.<br>&#x201c;Five minutes?&#x201d; Gaia asked, and the girl nodded.<br>&#x201c;Mlass Gaia, you can&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; Peter said. &#x201c;It could be an ambush.&#x201d;<br>Gaia knew he was right, but something about the girl&#x2019;s stoic demeanor with her wound had tempered Gaia&#x2019;s suspicions of her. She put a hand on the girl&#x2019;s shoulder and studied her eyes, seeing hunger there, and wary desperation.<br>&#x201c;Will I regret trusting you?&#x201d; Gaia asked.<br>The girl shook her head once, and her voice was little more than a croak. &#x201c;Please. It&#x2019;s safe.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go with her,&#x201d; Peter said. &#x201c;You belong back in camp. There must be fifty people down there with questions for you right now.&#x201d;<br>Gaia&#x2019;s duties were precisely what she&#x2019;d wanted to evade for five minutes when she&#x2019;d set out for a walk on the ridge, and here was the perfect excuse to do it.<br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ll take you with us,&#x201d; Gaia said, and turned to her other scouts. &#x201c;The rest of you be careful. If this girl had been hostile, she could have picked off any number of us from here, but I suppose you all realize that.&#x201d; She put her knife away. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;re not back in thirty minutes, tell Chardo Will he&#x2019;s in charge.&#x201d;<br>Without waiting to see her orders followed, Gaia headed off into the wasteland with the little nomad. The girl led her through the brush, moving quickly and silently in the fading light. Her outfit was exactly the brown-gray color of the land, so watching her was like seeing a piece of the landscape itself shifting through the shadows. Gaia could hear Peter following behind her.<br>They&#x2019;d gone only a short distance before Gaia felt her queasiness again, only worse. She kept on, hoping it would pass, but in a matter of seconds, she was shaking and clammy. &#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; she called.<br>Grimly, Gaia put her hand out against a boulder, waiting while nausea hit her full force. She buckled over with her guts clenched and grit her teeth, hoping she wouldn&#x2019;t actually throw up. For an instant longer, she thought she could control her stomach, but then she heaved into the shadow of the boulder.<br><i>Lovely</i>, she thought. At least she avoided drooling on her trousers.<br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t still be nauseous,&#x201d; Peter said. &#x201c;Everyone else was finished two weeks ago. Have you been sick all along?&#x201d;<br>She closed her eyes, waiting for her stomach to settle.<br>&#x201c;Mlass Gaia?&#x201d; he said more gently, nearer.<br>She didn&#x2019;t want Peter&#x2019;s gentleness. She waved him back and spat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m good.&#x201d;<br>The girl was staring at Gaia, her eyes wide with concern. She tilted her face and made a gesture for a big round belly in front of herself before pointing to Gaia.<br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not pregnant,&#x201d; Gaia said, acutely aware that Peter was listening. &#x201c;The problem is, I can&#x2019;t shoot things. Living things, that is. I get sick afterward, every time.&#x201d; No amount of tr...</p><h2>SPIDER-MAN: MILES MORALES VOL. 4</h2><p>The Sinister Six reborn!

There exists, in fact, a massive, rotten underside. But who has the time and sufficient quantities of NoDoz to read the entire book? In this collection of brief, entertaining essays, written in a tone both matter-of-fact incredulous and wryly sarcastic, Andrew Bernardin dives deep beneath the Bible's cover to share a peek of some of the customarily cloaked, sordid content. He reveals both how "God's inerrant word" has been worded differently in many versions of the Bible, and how &#x201c;God&#x2019;s Message&#x201d; changes from Genesis to Revelation within each Bible. In addition to the essays, Naked contains bonus, eye-opening verses translated into blunt, everyday English. From front to back, The Naked Bible strips bare the outright scandalous and plainly silly alike. If you care to know more about the lesser known Bible, this is one fun way to do it. - [Revised 04/11 to update formatting and correct typographical errors.]</p><p>Andrew Bernardin is a former psychology professor.

Terry has also designed a range of `three greens&#39; - specially mixed greens to save you having to do it! The book opens with a description of the brushes and their uses, followed by a list of the materials you will need to get started, and Terry&#39;s palette of colours. Descriptions of how to use each brush to best effect with step-by-step examples show exactly how to achieve the desired effect and build up confidence with painting features in the landscape. The `Stippler px&#39; for example is specially designed for painting trees and foliage. Step-by-step examples show how to paint a simple tree using the brush, focusing on summer foliage, scraping out, painting tree trunks, stones and grasses. The section closes with a painting by Terry that combines all the techniques described using each particular brush. A chapter on basic watercolour techniques - wet into wet, dry brushwork, masking fluid, etc. is followed by the demonstrations - six in total. Each demonstration comprises a list of materials followed by up to 31 stages. Terry is a popular teacher who understands the problems many amateur painters face.

The Military Order of Teutonic Knights was one of the three most famous Crusading Orders; the others being the Templars and the Hospitallers. Like these two, the Teutonic Knights initially focused upon the preservation of the Crusader States in the Middle East. Wielding their swords in the name of their faith, the crusading knights set out to reclaim Jerusalem. Unlike the Templars they survived the crises of identity and purpose which followed the loss of the last Crusader mainland enclaves in the late thirteenth century and, like the Hospitallers, they managed to create a new purpose - and a new field of combat - for themselves. Whereas the Hospitallers focused their energies in the eastern Mediterranean battling against Muslim armies, the Teutonic Knights shifted their efforts to the Baltic, to the so-called Northern Crusades against pagan Prussians and Lithuanians and, to a lesser extent, against Orthodox Christian Russia. As a result the Order of Teutonic Knights became a significant power, not only in the Baltic but in north-central Europe as a whole. Paradoxically, however, it was their fellow Catholic Christian Polish neighbours who became their most dangerous foes, breaking the Order&#39;s power in the mid-fifteenth century. The Teutonic Knights lingered on in what are now Estonia and Latvia for another century, but this was little more than a feeble afterglow. This title will examine this fascinating military and religious order in detail, revealing the colourful history of the crusades within Europe itself which inexorably changed the future of the continent.</p><p>Born in 1944, David Nicolle worked in the BBC&#39;s Arabic service for a number of years before gaining an MA from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, and a doctorate from Edinburgh University.

Yet the two are drawn powerfully together even when it is clear they are bound to bring each other grief. Their difficult marriage leads them and their children to a house made of glass in the Connecticut countryside, to the avenues of Manhattan, and to the blue waters of Long Island Sound. Glass breaks, love hurts, and families make their own rules. Ultimately, it falls to their grandson, Will, to solve the emotional puzzle of his family and of his own identity.</p><p>Alice Hoffman is the bestselling author of seventeen acclaimed novels, including The Ice Queen, Practical Magic, Here on Earth, The River King, Blue Diary, Illumination Night, Turtle Moon, Seventh Heaven, and At Risk, as well as the highly praised story collections Local Girls and Blackbird House.Mare Winningham's reading is level, her delivery almost factual, providing strong roots that ground us when Hoffman leaps into moments of magical realism in telling the story of Arlyn Singer. On the day of her father's funeral, 17-year-old Arlyn waits for her true love to show up. Enter the distant John Moody, an unlikely candidate. Winningham's even tones seem to record the characters' resignation--their adjustment to a bad marriage, Arlyn's conclusion of a love affair, and her acceptance of her own death. In later parts of the audio, Winningham's steady narration records the descent of Arlyn's lost son into drugs and despair, the pain of her daughter, and the sadness of Arlyn herself, who haunts John's life and home, looking for resolution.

On principle we incline to rate a sacrificial game more highly than a positional game. Instinctively we place the moral value above the scientific. We honor Capablanca, but our hearts beat higher when Morphy&#x2019;s name is mentioned." &#x2014; Introduction.<br>Perhaps the strongest Austrian-born grandmaster of the20th century, Rudolf Spielmann (1883&#x2013;1942) defeated such world-class opponents as Nimzovich, Tartakower, Bogoljubov &#x2014; and even the great Capablanca. Among the reasons for his success was his mastery of the art of sacrifice. In this ground-breaking classic, distilled from 40 years of tournament play, he outlines the hard-won lessons that enable a player to win games by giving up pieces!<br>Drawing on dozens of his own games against such topflight players as Schlechter, Tartakower, Bogoljubov, Reti, Rubinstein and Tarrasch, Spielmann describes and analysis various type of sacrifices: (positional, for gain, mating) and real sacrifices: (for development, obstructive, preventive, line-clearance, vacating, deflecting and more). The result was the first systematic attempt to explain and exploit the theory of chess sacrifice; it remains an extremely helpful and useful weapon in the arsenal of chess players at every level.</p><p>Austrian Grandmaster Rudolf Spielmann (1883-1942) was renowned for his brilliant attacking chess. Dubbed &#34;:The Master of Attack,&#34; his play was characterized by creative sacrifices and brilliancies."Grandmaster Karsten M�ller&#x2019;s notes to the original text, along with the new material, brilliantly complements Spielmann&#x2019;s classic work.

Yet this popular series presents a perplexing&#x2014;even divisive&#x2014;challenge to the Christian community. Although the books present a clear picture of the epic battle between good and evil, they appear to support the use of magic and have had a controversial impact on our culture.

Once groundbreaking and now time-honored, Managing at the Speed of Change has helped countless business leaders learn how to orchestrate transitions vital to their organizations&#x2019; success. Rather than focusing on what to change, this book&#x2019;s aim is far more valuable: It shows readers how to change.<br>Daryl R. Conner, founder and chairman of the consulting firm Conner Partners, is a leading expert on change management. He has served as &#x201c;change doctor&#x201d; for clients that include non-profit enterprises, government agencies and administrations, and Fortune 500 companies in an array of industries such as Abbott Laboratories, PepsiCo, American Express, Catholic Healthcare West, JPMorgan Chase, and the U.S. Navy.<br>Based on Conner&#x2019;s long-term research and his decades of consulting experience, Managing at the Speed of Change uses simple, easy-to-understand language and elegant visuals to explore the dynamics of change, and in doing so, teaches readers<br>� why major change is difficult to assimilate<br>� what distinguishes resilient individuals from those who suffer future shock<br>� how and why resistance forms<br>� how people become committed to change<br>� why organizational culture is so important to the success of change<br>� the roles most central to change in organizational settings<br>� why powerful teamwork is at the heart of achieving change objectives, and how to foster it<br><br>In this pioneering book, updated for the twenty-first century, Conner demonstrates how both individuals and organizations can develop the capacity not only to endure change but to thrive on it.</p><p>Finally, an indispensable source for anyone - from mid-level managers through top-level executives - who needs to implement business decisions on time and within budget. In today's ever-fluctuating world, it's not enough to recognize that you and the way you do business need to change. You must know how to make changes quickly, effectively, economically, and with as little political fallout as possible, or you are bound to fail. Everywhere today you hear the concern of those trying to adapt to the rapid flux created by an uncertain economy, ever-changing market demands, and the threat of international competition. Businesses worry that they can't keep up, and every day another corporation falls prey to the myth that the status quo still works. Daryl Conner, president and founder of the consulting firm Organizational Development Resources, Inc. (ODR), is the world's number one expert on change management. ODR, Inc., has served as "change doctor" for clients such as Georgia Pacific, Honeywell, IBM, Levi Strauss, Mobil Oil, AT&amp;T, Chase Manhattan, JCPenney, Pepsi-Cola Company, and numerous organizations and governments in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia, South Africa, and the former Soviet Union. Conner has taken his twenty years of change management experience and written a ground-breaking guide on resilient, successful change. His system focuses on how to change rather than what to change. Business people at all levels now face the major challenge of initiating company-wide reorganization plans, responding quickly to competition, establishing new products and markets, and adapting themselves smoothly to fluctuations in the economy. Conner's uniquely successful methods will teachtoday's managers to negotiate these transitions by teaching them what distinguishes resilient people from those who suffer future shock; why major change is difficult to assimilate; the key elements and the flow of events involved in human transition; what roles are central to change in organizational settings; how and why resistance forms; how people become committed to change; why organizational culture is so important to a change's success, and why powerful teamwork is at the heart of achieving change objectives. In this roller-coaster business climate, the adage "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" doesn't work anymore. Pepsi-Cola and the rest of Daryl Conner's clients will attest to that. Don't be daunted - start Managing at the Speed of Change and meet today's challenges with confidence.aryl Conner runs the world&#39;s premier consulting firm devoted exclusively to change. Here, he coaches middle- and top-level executives in implementing business innovations on time and under budget.</p><h2>Navajo Alphabet: The Navajo Sound System: Vowels and Consonants (Dine&#x301; bizaad bi&#x301;hoosh&#x2019;aah!)</h2><p>The letters in this Navajo Alphabet book are introduced with beautiful photos, reflecting Navajo culture, tradition and environment.

Gen also finds himself confronting the corrosive effects on postwar Hiroshima society of drugs and the arms industry. With the Korean War offering new business opportunities, a new generation of death merchants holds sway in Japan. Gen, his teacher mentor, and other peace-minded citizens are forced to struggle against red-baiting school officials, violent nationalists, and government censorship.</p><p>Nakazawa was born in Hiroshima, and was six years old when the city was destroyed by an atomic bomb in 1945.

He must draw up his plans using the blood of others...<br><br><b>In a compelling tale of intrigue and injustice, K. J. Parker's embittered hero takes up arms against his enemies, using the only weapons he has left to him: his ingenuity and his passion -- his devices and desires.</b><br></p><p>K.J. Parker is a pseudonym.Parker (the Scavenger trilogy) raises the bar for realistic fantasy war craft with this series opener. When the engineering guild sentences Ziani Vaatzes to death for improving on its supposedly perfect specifications for mechanical toys, he manages to escape Mezentia and throws in his lot with its recently defeated enemy, city-state Eremia. In exile, Vaatzes sets up shop making weapons, but his real goal is to create a new kind of engine&#x2014;one made of human components, designed to reunite him with his family. He painstakingly executes a slow-moving master plan involving love, betrayal and secrets among the two countries' leaders. The tragic aftermath of the climactic battle forces a rereading of all that went before. It takes some hard slogging to get through assiduously researched technical descriptions of everything from dressing a duke to hunting a boar, and a few too many coincidences and expository speeches mar Parker's otherwise exquisite feat of literary engineering. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A woman driving her mother&#x2019;s ashes across the country has a strangely transcendent run-in with an injured hawk. Two aging widowers, in Stetsons and bolo ties, together make a daily pilgrimage to the local Denny&#x2019;s, only to be divided by the attentions of their favorite waitress. Peering unblinkingly into the chasms that separate fathers and sons, husbands and wives, friends and strangers, these powerful tales bear the unmistakable signature of an American master.</p><p>In his second collection of short fiction, <i>Great Dream of Heaven</i>, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Sam Shepard offers a resonant examination of interpersonal crisis and revelation in 18 lean tales. At times humorous, tense, and tragic, these stories often focus on the elusive search for connection and understanding, visiting characters at key moments of consciousness or detachment. Seized by compulsion or repression, many in this work disengage from life by assuming familiar roles or patterns. In "The Stout of Heart," a man obsessed with horse breeding locks himself in his room annually to study catalogues, shutting out his family, while in "An Unfair Question," another man's frustration with his role as husband and father surfaces when he engages a party guest in friendly conversation and ends up holding her at gunpoint. These stories achieve an understated impact due in part to Shepard's knack for acute dialogue and descriptions that reveal his dramatist's eye for sparse but evocative detail. In "Living the Sign," a handmade sign in a fast food restaurant inspires a man to self-awareness, though he finds that its teenage creator is only dimly aware of its significance. "The Remedy Man," the collection's first and strongest story, tells of a guarded boy who comes to realize his potential by helping E.V., the road-worn title character (a fixer of bad horses), break a stallion. "Horse is just like a human being," E.V. tells him. "He's just gotta know his limits. Once he finds that out he's a happy camper." Offering many such moments of distilled wisdom, the stories in <i>Great Dream of Heaven</i> are no less brief but memorable encounters. <i>--Ross Doll</i>&#x201c;Extraordinary by any measure. . . .

He dreamed of photographing the Arctic&#x2019;s most iconic animal, the polar bear, in its natural habitat. <br><br> It was a seemingly simple plan: Haul a 22-foot fishing boat northeast a few thousand miles, launch, and shoot the perfect polar bear photo. After an inauspicious start and endless days spent driving to the end of northern Canada&#x2019;s road system, he backed his C-Dory, C-Sick, into a small tributary of Hudson Bay. Battered by winds and plagued by questionable navigation, Paul slowly motored C-Sick north in the hopes of finding the melting summer ice that should be home to more than a thousand polar bears. He struggled along for weeks, grounding on rocks, hiding from storms, and stopping in isolated Inuit villages, until finally, he found the ice and the world was transformed. The ice had brought hundreds of walrus into the bay and dozens of polar bears arrived to hunt and feed. For a few magical days, he was surrounded by incredible wildlife photo ops . He was hooked.<br><br> A hilarious and evocative misadventure, <i>Arctic Solitaire</i> shares Paul Souders exploits across four summers, six hundred miles of a vast inland sea, and the unpredictable Arctic wilderness&#x2015;and also offers an insightful look at what compels a person to embark on adventure.

Since questions about the relationship are perhaps the ones most often asked of the astrologer, the art of synastry is a basic skill to practice astrology at any but the most casual level.

Douglas Woodward tackles the turbulent and tense relationship between Russia and the United States as the backdrop to Ezekiel&#x2019;s famed prophecy&#x2014;the &#x201c;Battle of Gog and Magog.&#x201d; The author argues the specter of nuclear war looms as prelude to the prophesied war when Gog gathers his great army to attack Israel. Woodward&#x2019;s assessment builds upon scores of timely articles composed by respected journalists and research papers written by geopolitical experts who study the Middle East, compiling their findings and documenting why a great war may explode in the days just ahead as a result of Islamic terror, Russian militarism, and failed U.S. policies toward Iran, Iraq, Israel, and most recently the fight against ISIS in Syria. Woodward challenges popular prophetic teachings arguing the next war in the Middle East is not the &#x201c;Psalm 83 War,&#x201d; why Russia and not Turkey will be Ezekiel&#x2019;s Gog, why advances in Russian weaponry threaten the security of the United States, and how U.S. policy is at fault for today&#x2019;s instability in Syria and Iraq. Expositing Ezekiel 38-39, the author uncovers the dark forces behind Gog and shows when the event occurs during the last days. The fate of America also comprises a major theme of this study.</p><p></p><h2>Silence in Hanover Close: A Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Novel</h2><p><p>When Inspector Thomas Pitt is asked to reopen a three-year-old murder case that had taken place in London&#x2019;s luxurious Hanover Close, he is all too aware that his superiors want him to simply smooth things over.

I believe this edition offers much improved clarity and enhances the effectiveness and quality of the Four-book Series overall. The purpose of this book, along with volumes 2, 3, and 4, is to explain, in a progressive manner, the seminal relationship between astronomy, myth, and modern religion. The book shows that ancient mythology was, in fact, a written record of the celestial movements within the Cosmos, under the type of mythical deities. I have chosen the stories of the mythological characters of the Bible and Quran, including the mythical Jesus Christ, as a means of demonstrating the astronomical correlations between the lives of these biblical characters and the transits of the sun and other cosmic lights. M.H.J.</p><p>Most of us did not choose the religion that we worship under, no more than we chose to be born into this fickle world of challenges, intermixed with delights. Our religious affiliations, for the most part, are accidents of birth, that is to say, whatever religious persuasion we inherited from our parents or culture is the religion we have unsuspectingly embraced as our own, not by choice but rather in keeping with enduring family traditions. This, we have done, without hesitation, examination, or question. We have assumed that what we adore as our faith or belief is true and correct. We have grown from childhood to adulthood with the assumption that we and our fellow believers are on the right path to god and salvation. We also sincerely believe that the religious cultures of others outside of our own denomination or creed are inferior to our own tenets or otherwise invalid, that is to say, not genuinely connected to the true god; the true god being, of course, designated as our god that we have named or labeled as Yahweh, Jesus, or Allah. We, of the various monotheistic faiths or denominations, proclaim confidently that god himself is the architect and author of our creeds, and that all those who do not share our beliefs are either pagans, infidels, savages, or perhaps misguided; and are not worthy of the deliverance and exaltation that awaits us as god s chosen. Some of us, at the extreme ends of our religious spectrums, even go so far as to say that those who worship outside of our own ranks, that is to say followers of other faiths, do not even possess souls worth saving, that We (a we in the category of a sometimes extreme or fanatical Jew, Christian, or Muslim) are the chosen and destined of god. Such are the daily refrains of the Christians, Muslims, and Jews each, who in their own parochial delusional styles and modes postulate that We are god s chosen. Of course such (monotheistic) claims of superiority in the eyes of god can never be verified as valid, except that a true Judgment Day actually arrives, and the awaited savior descends from the heavens in mighty force to proclaim his chosen, and destroy all others. This, of course, will never happen. The proclamations of the monotheists as to the preferred status of their belief systems is based on the enthusiasm, faith, and loyalty of the believers, not on facts in evidence. It cannot be proven that god is a Jew, a Christian, or a Muslim; or that god desires that we become such.

With your permission, we would like to publish a transcription of the taped lecture in the local publication Frog Calls, so as to make available to those who were unable to attend in person a chance to appreciate and learn from your use of language.</p><p>On the morning of the first day of the year I accompanied you on a visit to my aunt, an obstetrician for more than fifty years, and though she spoke too quickly in her accented Chinese for you to grasp everything she said, I am sure she left a deep impression on you. In your talk the next morning you cited her often in support of your views of literature. You said you came away with an image of a doctor racing across a frozen river on a bicycle; another of her with a medical kit slung over her back and an open umbrella in one hand, trouser cuffs rolled up, as she forces her way through a mass of croaking frogs; yet another of a doctor laughing joyfully as she holds a newborn infant in her hands, her sleeves spattered with blood; and finally one of a doctor with a care-laden face, a cigarette dangling from her lips, clothing rumpled&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you said that all these mental pictures sometimes come together into a single image and at other times split into discrete fragments, like a series of carvings. You urged local literature fans to create poignant works of art out of my aunt&#x2019;s life, either in fiction, in verse, or in drama. Sensei, your encouragement has produced a creative passion in many of us. An associate at the county cultural centre has already begun a novel about a village obstetrician, and though my understanding of what my aunt accomplished is much greater than his, I do not want to enter into a competition and will leave the writing of a novel to him. What I want to do, sensei, is write a play about my aunt&#x2019;s life. On the night of the second, when we were talking as we sat on the kang at my house, I experienced an epiphany thanks to your high praise and detailed analyses, as well as your unique insights into the plays of the Frenchman, Sartre. I want to write, I feel I must write librettos as fine as The Flies and Dirty Hands, with the audacious goal of becoming a great playwright. With your instruction as a guide, I will proceed slowly, without forcing the issue, as patient as a frog on a lily pad waiting for insects to come its way. But when I put pen to paper, it will be with the speed of a frog jumping up to snatch an insect out of the air.</p><p>When I was seeing you off at the Qingdao airport, you asked me to send you in letters the story of my aunt&#x2019;s life. Although she is still alive and well, I could describe her life using such potent metaphors as &#x2018;surging forth magnificently&#x2019; and &#x2018;rife with twists and turns&#x2019;. There are so many stories, and I don&#x2019;t know how long this letter ought to be, so with your indulgence, I will put my meagre talents to use by simply writing until the time has come to stop. In this age of computers, writing a letter with pen and paper has become a luxury, but a pleasurable one, and I hope that as you read this, you enjoy a taste of olden times.</p><p>While I&#x2019;m at it, I want to tell you that my father phoned to say that on the lunar twenty-fifth, red blossoms burst onto the tree in our yard, the one whose unique shape prompted you to call it a &#x2018;talented&#x2019; old plum. Many people came to witness our blooming plum, including my aunt. My father said that a feathery snow fell that day, saturated with a redolence of plum blossoms that cleared the head of anyone who smelled it.</p><p>Your student, Tadpole</p><p>21 March 2002, in Beijing</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>Sensei, an old custom in my hometown dictated that a newborn child is given the name of a body part or organ. Nose Chen, for instance, Eyes Zhao, Colon Wu, Shoulder Sun&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I haven&#x2019;t looked into the origin of this custom, but I imagine it embodied the outlook of &#x2018;those who are badly named live long&#x2019;. Either that or it evolved from a mother&#x2019;s thoughts that a child represented a piece of her body. The custom is no longer followed, as young parents have no interest in naming their children in such an unusual way. Local children these days are endowed with elegant and distinctive names of TV characters in dramas from Hong Kong, Taiwan, even Japan and Korea. Most of those who were named the earlier way have adopted more conventional names, most but not all. We still have Chen Er (Ears) and Chen Mei (Brow).</p><p>Chen Er and Chen Mei were the daughters of Chen Bi (Nose), my classmate and my friend. We entered Great Sheep&#x2019;s Pen Elementary School in the fall of 1960. That was during the famine, and nearly all my strongest memories of the time deal with food. I&#x2019;ve told the story of eating coal. Most people think I made that up, but I swear on my aunt&#x2019;s good name it&#x2019;s true. </p><p>The coal was part of a ton of high-grade ore from the Longkou Coal Mine, so glossy I could see my face in it. I&#x2019;ve never seen the likes of it since. Wang Jiao (Foot), the owner of a horse cart, transported the coal over from the county seat. Wang, a man with a square head, a thick neck and a bad stammer, had a bright look in his eyes when he spoke, his face flushed from the effort. He had a son, Wang Gan (Liver), and a daughter named Wang Dan (Gallbladder). They were twins, and both were my classmates. Wang Gan was tall and well built, while his sister never grew to full size and remained a tiny thing&nbsp;&#x2013; to be unkind, a dwarf. Everyone said she was so small because her brother had sucked up all the nutrition in their mother&#x2019;s womb. After school was out, we ran over with our backpacks to watch Wang Jiao shovel the coal to the ground, where it landed crisply on a growing pile. He stopped to wipe his sweaty neck with a blue cloth he&#x2019;d wrapped around his waist, and when he saw his son and daughter, he shouted: Go home and mow the grass. </p><p>Wang Dan turned and headed for home, struggling to keep her balance as she ran, like an infant learning how to walk; a lovely sight. Wang Gan backed up but did not run. He was proud of his father&#x2019;s occupation. Children these days, even those whose fathers are airline pilots, are not as proud of theirs as he was of his. Wang drove a horse cart whose wheels threw up dust as it rumbled along; an old branded warhorse said to have distinguished itself by once towing an artillery piece was between the shafts, while a bad-tempered mule was up front in a harness, a mean animal known to kick and bite. That aside, it was astonishingly powerful and could run like the wind. No one but Wang Jiao could control it. Though many villagers admired his line of work, they kept their distance from the mule, which had already bitten two youngsters: Yuan Sai (Cheek), son of Yuan Lian (Face); and Wang Dan, who had been bitten and picked up by the head while playing in front of the house. We were in awe of Wang Jiao, who stood over six-two, with broad shoulders, and the strength of an ox. He could lift a stoneroller weighing two hundred jin over his head. But what really wowed us was his skill with a whip. That time the crazy mule bit Yuan Sai, Wang pulled back the brake and, with one foot on each of the shafts, brought the tip of his whip down on the animal&#x2019;s rump with a crack that drew blood. The mule reacted by kicking out, but then began to quake as its forelegs buckled and its head hit the ground, mouth in the dirt, rump raised ready for another hit. It was Yuan Sai&#x2019;s father, Yuan Lian, who came to its rescue. It&#x2019;s okay, Old Wang, he said, sparing the animal further anguish. Yuan was our village&#x2019;s ranking official, the Party secretary. Not heeding his word was not an option for Wang Jiao. After the crazy mule bit Wang Dan, we eagerly awaited another good show, but instead of striking out with his whip, Wang Jiao scooped up a handful of roadside lime and pressed it against the girl&#x2019;s head as he carried her inside. The mule did not taste his whip this time, but his wife did, just before Wang kicked his son. </p><p>That crazy mule was one of our favourite topics of conversation. Skinny as a rail, the indentations above both eyes were so deep they could accommodate hen&#x2019;s eggs. Its eyes emitted a sorrowful gaze, as if it were about to howl. How a skinny animal like that could exert such strength was a mystery. We were talking about that as we drew up to the mule. Wang Jiao stopped shovelling coal and glared menacingly, backing us up terrified. The pile in front of the school kitchen grew higher and higher, the load of coal on the cart kept getting smaller. We sniffed in unison at the strange aroma in the air, a bit like burning pine or roasting potatoes. Our sense of smell drew our gaze to the pile of glistening coal as Wang Jiao flicked the reins and drove his cart out of the schoolyard. This time we didn&#x2019;t chase it out of the yard, as we usually did, even risking the bite of Wang&#x2019;s whip when we tried to climb aboard to satisfy our desire for a ride. No, we kept our eyes glued to the pile of coal as we shuffled forward. Old Wang, the school cook, wobbled over with two buckets of water on his shoulder pole. His daughter, Renmei, was also a classmate who, much later, would become my wife. She was one of the rare children not burdened with the name of a body part, and that was because her father had attended school. As the one-time head of a commune animal-husbandry station, a careless comment had cost him his job and sent him back to his village. He observed us with a wary eye. Did he think we were planning to raid his kitchen? Go on, you little shits, get out of here! There&#x2019;s nothing here for you to eat. Go home and suck your mothers&#x2019; teats. We heard him, of course,...</p></p><h2>Getting Free (New Leaf)</h2><p>Since its original publication in 1982, <i>Getting Free</i> has changed the lives of tens of thousands of women. Written in an accessible style, packed with practical information and answers, special exercises designed to help a woman recognize abuse, and several success stories, <i>Getting Free</i> remains an important resource today and this updated edition makes it an all the more relevant resource.<br>In this expanded edition, Ginny NiCarthy features important new information from the latest studies and most recent research on the subject. New chapters include an analysis of whether batterers&#x2019; treatment really works, which programs help violent men change, and which do not; the results of research on the ways that many men who batter also abuse their children, and specific reactions of children to battering; the cultural and legal issues relevant to immigrant women; and a presentation of how religious beliefs and religious communities affect the real and perceived choices of women facing violence.</p><p>Although <i>Getting Free</i> was written in 1982, it is <i>still</i> called the bible of all domestic violence texts. It's not just the content of the book--twenty-four chapters covering a gamut of issues--but the tone. The problems of and solutions to domestic violence are clearly defined through the voices of women as they share their experiences and carve out their steps toward freedom.<p> Each chapter discusses a different phase in the experience of "getting free" and the problems surrounding each phase. Readers can reach for this book to look up specific domestic abuse issues or they can read it straight through. There is much to learn here--the history of battering as a phenomenon; the political and social aspects of abuse; the historical changes to the institutions of marriage and family, and more.</p><p> Chapter 4, "What Do You Owe Yourself?," helps women work toward a healthy autonomy and defines what each partner in a relationship deserves. Discussion on the unconscious expectations of marriage and romance segues into practical advice on the economics of single life. When reaching for <i>Getting Free</i> in crisis, readers might begin with Chapter 6, "Making the Decision," or Chapter 14, which argues for and against moving to a shelter. There is wise and compassionate counsel for the loneliness that can ensue from fleeing an abusive relationship.</p><p> At the time that <i>Getting Free</i> was first published, the more common feeling about domestic abuse was that women brought it on themselves. This landmark book changed that perception, not only bringing a pandemic social problem to light, but also offering a lifeline to thousands of women. It continues to do so.</p>Ginny NiCarthy has written and co-written many books that have helped change the lives of thousands of women, including <i>You Don&#x2019;t Have to Take It!: A Woman&#x2019;s Guide to Confronting Emotional Abuse at Work; You Can Be Free: An Easy-to-Read Handbook for Abused Women; The Ones Who Got Away: Women Who Left Abusive Partners;</i> and <i>Talking It Out: A Guide for Abused Women.</i> For twenty-five years she worked as a therapist and was active in the movement to end violence against women.<br></p><h2>Walking with Ellen White: The Human Interest Story</h2><p>Ellen White was a real person who lived in the real world.

Leo Goldberger, a leading expert on the Danish rescue, hails the book as an &#x201c;educational gem,&#x201d; which describes the rescue in &#x201c;riveting detail&#x201d; by following one participant&#x2019;s rise from youthful bystander to rescuer to armed resister.</p> <p>Henny Sinding, daughter of a Danish navy officer, teamed with a fledgling resistance group to save three hundred Jews on a lighthouse supply boat named <i>Gerda III</i>. Each night for a month Henny bravely escorted Jews from secret rendezvous points to a dockside warehouse and then slipped them past Nazi sentries into <i>Gerda III</i>&#x2019;s cargo hold. <i>Gerda III</i>&#x2019;s crew completed the escape&#x2014;motoring daily past German warships and mines to unoccupied Sweden. </p> <p>After the rescue Henny&#x2019;s team became one of Denmark&#x2019;s leading sabotage groups, while <i>Gerda III</i> continued to save persons hunted by the Nazis. </p> <p>The story of <i>Gerda III</i> and the people associated with it&#x2014;Henny; Mix, the dashing young resistance fighter who she loved; and many giants of the Danish resistance&#x2014;epitomizes the story of a nation that rose from a humbling surrender to battle the Nazis and hand the Gestapo its most glaring defeat. </p></p><p><p>In 2009 Howard Veisz left a litigation career and went to sea. After a two year sailing voyage around the North Atlantic, Howard and his wife settled on Connecticut&#x2019;s Mystic River, and Howard began work as a shipyard volunteer at the Mystic Seaport maritime museum. There, <i>Gerda III</i>, caught his eye. </p> <p>With a father and grandparents who barely escaped Nazi Germany, <i>Gerda III</i>&#x2019;s role in rescuing Denmark&#x2019;s Jews drew Howard in. While helping to preserve <i>Gerda III</i>, Howard began a four year mission to reconstruct its history. Howard travelled to Denmark to locate and interview descendants of the people who carried out <i>Gerda III</i>&#x2019;s rescue missions; scoured Danish archives; visited the docks from which <i>Gerda III</i> set out; gathered accounts by leaders of the<i> Gerda III</i> rescue group that had never appeared in English; and assembled translators to uncover the fascinating story that had been buried in those writings for over seventy years.</p></p><h2>The Beast Within (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>His haunting, impressionistic study of a man&#39;s slow corruption by jealousy, Emile Zola&#39;s The Beast Within (La Bete Humaine) is translated from the French with an introduction and notes by Roger Whitehouse in Penguin Classics. Roubaud is consumed by a jealous rage when he discovers a sordid secret about his young wife&#39;s past. The only way he can rest is by forcing her to help him murder the man involved, but there is a witness - Jacques Lantier, a fellow railway employee. Jacques, meanwhile, must contend with his own terrible impulses, for every time he sees a woman he feels the overwhelming desire to kill. In the company of Roubaud&#39;s wife, Severine, he finds peace briefly, yet his feelings for her soon bring disasterous consequences. A key work in the Rougon-Macquart cycle, The Beast Within is one of Zola&#39;s most dark and violent works - a tense thriller of political corruption and a graphic exploration of the criminal mind. Roger Whitehouse&#39;s vivid translation is accompanied by an introduction discussing Zola&#39;s depiction of the railways, politics and the legal system and the influence of the studies of criminology and the Jack the Ripper murders on his novel. This edition also includes a chronology, suggestions for further reading and notes. Emile Zola (1840-1902) was the leading figure in the French school of naturalistic fiction. His principal work, Les Rougon-Macquart, is a panorama of mid-19th century French life, in a cycle of 20 novels which Zola wrote over a period of 22 years, including Au Bonheur des Dames (1883), The Beast Within (1890), Nana (1880), and The Drinking Den (1877). If you enjoyed The Beast Within, you might like Zola&#39;s The Drinking Den, also available in Penguin Classics.</p><p>Emile Zola (1840-1902) was a French novelist and critic, the founder of the Naturalist movement in literature. Among Zola&#39;s most important works is his famous Rougon-Macquart cycle (1871-1893), which included such novels as L&#39;Assomoir (1877), about the suffering of the Parisian working-class, Nana (1880), dealing with prostitution, and Germinal (1885).

The word alone evokes images of ultra-high-performance street cars and dominating race cars. No other engine has earned as much street credibility and race success. This engine resides at the pinnacle of American V-8 performance, and cars that carry a Hemi are some of the rarest, most expensive, and legendary muscle cars ever made. When Chrysler threw the wraps off the 426 in 1964, it made history. In the 1964 Daytona 500, the new Hemi-powered stock cars finished 1-2-3-4, announcing Chrysler's new era of dominance in racing. Fast forward to today: recently an immaculate 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda convertible sold for $2.16 million at a 2006 Barrett Jackson collector car auction. The factory Hemi cars have become legendary, easily eclipsing all other muscle cars in performance and value. </p><p><i>How to Build Max-Performance Hemi Engines</i> details how to extract even more horsepower out of these incredible engines. All the block options from street versus race, new versus old, and iron versus aluminum are presented. Full detailed coverage on the reciprocating assembly is also included. Heads play an essential role in flowing fuel and producing maximum horsepower, and therefore receive special treatment. Author Richard Nedbal explores major head types, rocker-arm systems, head machining and prep, valves, springs, seats, porting quench control, and much more. All camshaft considerations are discussed as well, so you can select the best specification for your engine build. Induction options including EFI, aftermarket ignitions systems, high-performance oiling systems, and cooling systems are also covered. The book also examines in detail how to install and set up power adders such as nitrous oxide, superchargers, and turbochargers.</p></p><p>A lifetime Mopar and computer nut, Richard Nedbal sold his computer business to &#34;retire,&#34; and promptly opened Mopar Engines West. Little did he know that he would be busier in retirement than he was during his career. Word got out that Mopar Engines West (MEW) was building Hemis that were just a little more expensive than a crate Hemi, yet were very reliable even in race dress. Many racers couldn&#39;t believe that Rich&#39;s customers didn&#39;t seem to work on their engines at the track. Rich builds all variations of Mopar engines from Slant-6s to all-out blown Hemis.Once more, CarTech proves they know how to produce a very valuable and informative text on Mopar tech. ---Mopar Collector's Guide, October 2009<br><br>If you are working on a Hemi or not, books like this are worth their weight in gold.

During the last four years of Wiesel&#x2019;s life, he met frequently with Reich in New York, Chicago and Florida&#x2014;and spoke with him often on the phone&#x2014;to discuss the subject that linked them: Reich&#x2019;s father, Robert Reich, and Wiesel were both liberated from the Buchenwald death camp on April 11, 1945.<br> What had started as an interview assignment from the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;quickly evolved into a friendship and a partnership. Reich and Wiesel believed their colloquy represented a unique exchange between two generations deeply affected by a cataclysmic event. Wiesel said to Reich, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never done anything like this before,&#x201d; and after reading the final book, asked him not to change a word.<br> Here Wiesel&#x2014;at the end of his life&#x2014;looks back on his ideas and writings on the Holocaust, synthesizing them in his conversations with Reich. The insights on life, ethics, and memory&nbsp;that Wiesel offers&nbsp;and Reich illuminates will not only&nbsp;help the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors understand their painful inheritance, but will benefit everyone, young or old.</p><p><b>Howard Reich</b> has written for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> since 1978 and joined the staff in 1983. He is the author of five other books, including <i>Prisoner of Her Past: A Son's Memoir.</i> Reich has won an Emmy Award, and the Chicago Journalists Association named him Chicago Journalist of the Year in 2011."Howard Reich utilizes his considerable journalistic talents and unique perspective as a second-generation Holocaust survivor to elicit powerful insights from Elie Wiesel. This book will play an important role in making the Holocaust relevant to future generations.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Marion Blumenthal Lazan, coauthor of <i>Four Perfect Pebbles</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;In his struggle to understand his parents&#x2019; unimaginable and unspoken past, Howard Reich finds answers in these powerful conversations with Elie Wiesel....Reich&#x2019;s own poignant narrative is as compelling as the advice Wiesel offers, and in the end it is so satisfying to see how these two brilliant minds find solace through words and through love.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Mary Morris, author of <i>Gateway to the Moon </i>and<i> The River Queen</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;How does one survive the horrors of the Holocaust?

Minow, former chair of the Federal Communications Commission and author of <i>Inside the Presidential Debates</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Through his compelling, fascinating and poignant conversations with Elie Wiesel, Howard Reich shares his quest for a deeper understanding of the Holocaust and of the way mankind&#x2019;s darkest days shaped the lives of his survivor parents and ultimately his own. Reich does a masterful job of weaving his probing questions and the Nobel Laureate&#x2019;s insightful answers into a tapestry of Jewish identity and morality. This extremely personal and, at times, emotional book...makes clear that descendants, like Reich, of Holocaust survivors are now becoming the witnesses who carry the banner that declares one must never give up or give in to apathy and evil.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Allan Zullo, author of the Haunted Kids and Ten True Tales series</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br>"In Wiesel's words, 'To hear a witness is to become a witness.'

She&#x2019;s a cop, after all. It&#x2019;s just that finding out her boyfriend was cheating on her was enough drama for one night.

Sometimes the monster under the bed is real. Sometimes there truly is a bogeyman hiding in the closet.<br> <br>Sometimes people die.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think they saw us?&#x201d; Jenny Lange gasped as she fled across the overgrown vacant lot in Detroit&#x2019;s rough Eight Mile area. Moonlight silvered the bright banner of the fifteen-year-old&#x2019;s long blond hair, turned her face into a pale beacon as she glanced back over her shoulder. Dressed in a ski jacket, jeans and boots, she was little more than a slim shadow in the darkness. The night was black and cold. A biting wind whistled through the canyon made by the surrounding apartment buildings, whipping sparkling whirlwinds of snow from the crusty layer on the ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Lori Penski snorted with laughter. Also fifteen, she ran a couple of steps behind her best friend, Jenny, her flight slowed by an intermittent attack of the giggles. &#x201c;Did you see what they were <i>doing</i>?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? What were they doing?&#x201d; Micayla Lange&#x2019;s heart pounded so hard that she could hear it thudding in her ears even over the rapid-fire crunch of their feet punching through the snow. Slip-sliding along behind, she almost begged for an answer, knowing even as the words left her mouth that she was probably going to be ignored just like always. Only eleven and undersized, she was having trouble keeping up. Having hurried so as not to have been left behind when her big sister and her sister&#x2019;s friend had sneaked out of the apartment where they&#x2019;d been babysitting her and she&#x2019;d supposedly been asleep, she&#x2019;d grabbed her coat and stuck her bare feet in the sneakers she&#x2019;d worn to basketball practice earlier. The sneakers were proving no match for ten inches of snow: icy wet, they kept threatening to slide off with every step she took. Her feet and ankles burned from churning as fast as they could through the frozen slush, and her pajamas were wet almost to the knees. Even with her coat zipped clear to her throat, she was so cold that her skin stung.<br> <br>And scared. She was so, so scared. She and Jenny were never, ever supposed to leave the apartment at night while their mother was at work. They weren&#x2019;t even supposed to answer the door. This run-down section of Detroit was dangerous, riddled with crime even in broad daylight. They&#x2019;d only lived there for two months, since their parents had split up, and already they&#x2019;d gotten used to the sound of gunfire at night and learned to rush straight in from the school bus so that they would spend as little time as possible on the street.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here they come!&#x201d; Jenny&#x2019;s eyes went wide as she looked past the other girls, back toward the sixteen-story brick tenement that backed up to the vacant lot. With much shushing and giggling, Jenny and Lori had peeped in the windows of the basement apartment, where a bunch of boys the older girls knew had been&#x2014;what? Micayla had no clue. She hadn&#x2019;t made it all the way to the building before Lori had slipped and banged a knee into a window with a loud <i>clank</i> and the girls, choking with laughter, had bolted for home.<br> <br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Lori gasped as she and Micayla glanced back, too. Sure enough, Micayla saw three or four boys tearing around the corner of the building, shouting and pointing as they spotted the girls. But they weren&#x2019;t the only ones in the vacant lot in the middle of this frigid night. Off to the right, in the shadow of another of the boxlike apartment buildings, a lone figure stood watching. A man, Micayla thought, too big and bulky to be a teenager. Unlike the boys, who were loudly and enthusiastically giving chase, he melted into the darkness even as Micayla caught sight of him. A stray beam of moonlight slid over him to catch on something he was carrying: a pole? An aluminum baseball bat? Whatever it was was black, but it had a shiny metallic gleam that showed up as a quick, glittery flash as he stepped into the light spilling from an apartment window above him then just as quickly moved into the dark again. Micayla didn&#x2019;t know why, but something about the man made the hair stand up on the back of her neck.<br> <br><i>There&#x2019;s somebody else here,</i> she wanted to tell her sister. But she was too winded to say it out loud. Plus Jenny was too far ahead. And Jenny never paid attention to her, anyway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jenny! Micayla!&#x201d;<br> <br>At the sound of the familiar voice, sharp now with angry surprise, Micayla&#x2019;s attention riveted on the source. Wendy Lange, blond and slender like Jenny, stood wrapped in her shabby blue coat on the sidewalk in front of their apartment building, which was directly across the street from the vacant lot. The car she&#x2019;d just gotten out of pulled off down the street, engine rattling, taillights reflecting red off the knee-high piles of snow that lined the curb.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, no, it&#x2019;s Mom!&#x201d; Sounding horrified, Jenny slowed down, glancing around at her friend and her little sister in dismay, while Lori made a face and muttered, &#x201c;Busted&#x201d; out of the side of her mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom! Mom!&#x201d; Micayla shrieked, waving. Unlike Jenny, she was so glad to see their mother that the gladness felt as warm as a little ball of sunshine forming inside her. Mom meant safety, and she hadn&#x2019;t felt safe from the moment she&#x2019;d left the apartment. Now, suddenly, with their mother&#x2019;s eyes on them, she did. Stepping off the curb, Wendy waved back specifically at Micayla as she started across the street toward them. Despite the wave, Micayla could tell from the way she was walking that she was mad.<br> <br>At Jenny, though. Not at her. Her mother rarely got mad at her. Micayla&#x2019;s my good girl, was what she always said.<br> <br>Because Micayla always was.<br> <br>&#x201c;We went out to get some milk,&#x201d; Jenny hissed, backtracking to grab Micayla&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Hear? We were just going to walk down to the little all-night grocery on Hines because you wanted milk, but we got scared and decided to come back. Got that? Don&#x2019;t you dare say anything about us spying on the guys.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s gonna know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Jenny squeezed her hand so hard that Micayla yelped. &#x201c;Not if you don&#x2019;t tell her, she won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;O<i>kay</i>. You don&#x2019;t have to <i>hurt</i> me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You just better not tell.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I <i>won&#x2019;t</i>.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You girls get over here right now!&#x201d; It was their mother&#x2019;s stern voice. Micayla felt sorry for Jenny. Jenny got in trouble a lot, and Micayla hated it every time, whether Jenny deserved it or not.<br> <br>&#x201c;The guys took off,&#x201d; Lori muttered to Jenny, who glanced back.<br> <br>Micayla glanced back, too, and saw that the boys were indeed nowhere in sight. Only she, Jenny and Lori were left to face Wendy&#x2019;s wrath. Micayla felt a sinking sensation in the pit of her stomach. Jenny would probably get her face slapped at the very least, and the prospect made Micayla feel sick. She hated it when Mom and Jenny fought. Wendy would say that Jenny was the one who&#x2019;d been left in charge, and Jenny was <i>older</i>. Sometimes Micayla felt bad because, according to their mother, nothing was ever her fault. Although if she lied like Jenny wanted her to and got caught, this time it might be her fault and this time she might get her face slapped, too.<br> <br>That wasn&#x2019;t so good, either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come <i>on.&#x201d;</i> Jenny yanked on her hand. Lori had dropped back, obviously glad she wasn&#x2019;t the one whose mom was furiously marching toward them. By this time, Wendy had almost reached their side of the street. Stumbling a little because of the relentlessness with which Jenny was pulling her, Micayla kept her eyes on their mother as Wendy stepped carefully up onto the packed-snow path between the drifts that led to the sidewalk. Head bent, Wendy was watching her feet. The moonlight brightened her short blond hair, gleamed off the slick wet blackness of the street behind her, sent her long shadow stretching out toward the hurrying girls.<br> <br>That moment&#x2014;the sight of her mother bathed in moonlight, the feel of Jenny&#x2019;s warm hand clamped on her own, the wet smell of the snow, the sounds of the retreating car and their crunching footsteps, and the bite of the icy, blowing wind on her cheeks&#x2014;was frozen forever in Micayla&#x2019;s mind. The last tick of <i>before</i>. If only she could stop time right there. ...<br> <br>Because the <i>after</i> began a heartbeat later, when shots exploded through the night.<br> <br><i>Crack! Crack!</i><br> <br>The sound still bounced off the buildings, still reverberated in Micayla&#x2019;s ears, when Wendy crumpled. Just like that, like her bones had suddenly turned to dust. She toppled face-first into the snow, which instantly began to turn scarlet around her.<br> <br>Micayla screamed.<br> <br>And woke up.<br> <br>As cold as if she&#x2019;d actually been outside on that frigid night again.<br> <br>Which of course she wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>She was inside. The air around her was warm. The cold she was experiencing came from the frosty window glass she was doing a full-body press against. The curtain had been pulled back, and beyond the window&#x2014;actually one section of a wall of sliding glass doors&#x2014;the pool area glistened under the fresh layer of pristine white snow that had been falling since she&#x2019;d arrived at her uncle Nicco&#x2019;s lakeside mansion shortly after 5:00 p.m. Except for the pale gleam of moonlight reflecting off the snow, the world beyond the window was black as ink. Earlier, at the stroke of midnight, an explosion of fireworks had lit up the night sky as cash-strapped Motor City had thrown its cares aside and celebrated the New Year. She&#x2019;d watched, alone, through a downstairs window, then gone to bed.<br> <br><i>If it hadn&#x2019;t been for the glass, I would have been out there wandering barefoot in the snow right now,</i> Mick thought, and she felt her stomach knot.<br> <br>At least, from the absence of sound echoing around her, she felt safe in assuming that this time the soul-shaking scream she&#x2019;d let loose had been all in her head.<br> <br><i>Please God.</i><br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t need to see a clock to know that the time was right around 2:30 a.m. Just like it had been then. Plus it wasn&#x2019;t long after Christmas, as cold as a meat locker outside, spurting snow. And she&#x2019;d been upset when she&#x2019;d fallen asleep.<br> <br>Of course she&#x2019;d been sleepwalking again.<br> <br><i>I&#x2019;m twenty-seven fricking years old. Am I never going to outgrow this?</i><br> <br>Peeling herself away from the window, Mick ignored the mild vertigo that she always experienced when she woke up abruptly under these conditions, then took a deep, hopefully steadying, breath. Her heart, which had been pounding like a SWAT team at an unsub&#x2019;s door, started to slow down. Looking around, she tried to get her bearings.<br> <br>Having gone to sleep in one of the eight second-floor bedrooms, she was now two stories below, in the part of the vast, elaborately finished walk-out basement that led to the pool and tennis court. With no memory at all of how she had gotten there.<br> <br>Carefully she closed the curtain, blocking out the night.<br> <br>Her hands shook, but she chose to ignore that. Just like she ignored the ringing in her ears, the dryness of her mouth and the racing of her pulse.<br> <br>With the curtain closed, she was left standing in the dark. A pinpoint-size red glow up near the ceiling reminded her that security cameras were everywhere. At the thought that her unconscious perambulation might have been witnessed by one or more of the security guards manning the monitors from the gatehouse out front, she felt a slow flush of embarrassment creep over her body. The good news was, it chased away the last of the chill.<br> <br>She slept in flannel pajama bottoms and a tank top. The bottoms were red and loose, the top white and snug. Her long, horsetail-thick chestnut hair trailed over her shoulders in two braids. Not a look meant for public consumption, and not the image she wanted to project to the security guards. At five foot six, she was as lean as a whippet and superbly fit. Hard-bodied. Cool, competent, tough as nails. Right now, though, to anybody who happened to be watching, she probably looked the exact opposite.<br> <br>Current appearances notwithstanding, girly and vulnerable she was&nbsp;not.<br> <br>Mentally flipping the bird at the invisible watcher who might or might not be behind the camera, depending on the degree of slacking that was going on, she padded back down the carpeted hallway. There was an elevator, but she preferred to take the stairs. A little exercise was what she needed to take the edge off. She didn&#x2019;t sleepwalk much anymore, maybe two or three times a year, but she knew the drill: her thought processes would be cobwebby for hours if she didn&#x2019;t do something to shake them out.<br> <br>By the time she made it up the semicircular marble staircase to the second floor, her head was on straight and she felt normal again. Which wasn&#x2019;t necessarily a good thing. The anger and sense of betrayal that had been with her for almost twenty-four hours now had come back, and had once again settled into her stomach like a rock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bastard,&#x201d; she said out loud to her absent ex-boyfriend. She&#x2019;d said it to his face before she&#x2019;d left, along with a lot of other things. She didn&#x2019;t know why she&#x2019;d been so surprised to learn he&#x2019;d been cheating on her. She knew men. She knew cops.<br> <br>What was surprising was how much it hurt to find out that Homicide Investigator Nate Horacki of the Detroit PD was no better than the rest of them.<br> <br>This time yesterday, she would have said she was in love with him.<br> <br>But now ... no way. She wasn&#x2019;t that big of a ...<br> <br><i>Clink.</i><br> <br>Mick never would have heard the slight sound if she hadn&#x2019;t been right where she was, striding along the open second-floor gallery that ran across the top of the enormous, eye-popping entry hall, nearly at the doorway of the bedroom she was using, the one she always used, which she&#x2019;d come to think of as her way-luxurious home away from home. But she <i>was</i> there, and she <i>did</i> hear it. Stopping dead, she listened. To nothing at all except the hum of the heating system. Except for the faint glow of moonlight streaming through the windows, the house was dark. Not wanting to advertise her movements to anyone outside who might be interested, she hadn&#x2019;t turned on a light on her way back to her bedroom. Now every sense she possessed focused on the shadow-filled spaces stretching out all around her. The house was huge, and tonight, except for her, it was empty. At least, it was supposed to&nbsp;be.<br> <br><i>Clink</i>.<br> <br>There it was again. Mick went taut as a bowstring, every sense on the alert. The smell of pine from the Christmas garlands tied to the gallery&#x2019;s wrought-iron railing wafted in the air. Shimmery gold ornaments in a glass bowl on the console table to her left glinted as a shaft of moonlight played over them. Trying to remember how the house had looked before darkness had swallowed it up, she concluded that the tall, menacing shapes in the corners were the human-size toy soldiers and nutcrackers her aunt Hope, Uncle Nicco&#x2019;s wife, had used as Christmas decorations. She relaxed a little even as she listened hard.<br> <br>Silence once again blanketed everything. But she knew she hadn&#x2019;t imagined the sound. And it hadn&#x2019;t been a random creak that she could put down to the settling of floor joists or something equally innocent; it had been sharper and metallic. Purposeful, was how she characterized it. Which meant she needed to check it out.<br> <br>She embraced the thought with relish. Checking it out was something to do, something to think about, something she was good at. And it was a whole hell of a lot better than lying sleepless in her bed trying not to think, which she knew was the fate that awaited her for the rest of the night.<br> <br>Uncle Nicco...</p><h2>Not My White Savior: A Memoir in Poems</h2><p><b>A provocative and furious book about race, culture, identity and what it means to be an inter-country adoptee in America</b><br><br><b>Julayne Lee</b> was born in South Korea to a mother she never knew.

Over the centuries, Sicily has come under various rulers and has had a colorful history. It has been Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, Norman, Byzantine and now Italian. It is a model of architectural diversity and cosmopolitanism, with Roman villas, baroque palaces, medieval castles and Islamic vestiges. Through Sicilian architecture, landscapes as well as scenes from daily life, this book proudly unveils the many facets of Sicily. Fabrice Moireau spent weeks exploring the landscapes of Sicily with his palette and brushes; he beautifully depicts this land of mountains and lava, of sand and grapevines.</p><p>Fabrice Moireau was born in 1962 in Blois, France. He is a graduate of the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Appliques et des Metiers d&#39;Art in Paris. A great lover of architecture and Roman history, he strives in his watercolors, to convey the subtle play of light and the atmosphere of a city or landscape. He has illustrated many publications in the Sketchbook series including Paris Sketchbook, Rooftops of Paris, Loire Valley Sketchbook, Provence Sketchbook, Venice Sketchbook and New York Sketchbook, also published by Editions Didier Millet.</p><h2>Bellefleur</h2><p><p>A wealthy and notorious clan, the Bellefleurs live in a region not unlike the Adirondacks, in an enormous mansion on the shores of mythic Lake Noir. They own vast lands and profitable businesses, they employ their neighbors, and they influence the government. A prolific and eccentric group, they include several millionaires, a mass murderer, a spiritual seeker who climbs into the mountains looking for God, a wealthy noctambulist who dies of a chicken scratch. </p><p><em>Bellefleur</em> traces the lives of several generations of this unusual family. At its center is Gideon Bellefleur and his imperious, somewhat psychic, very beautiful wife, Leah, their three children (one with frightening psychic abilities), and the servants and relatives, living and dead, who inhabit the mansion and its environs. Their story offers a profound look at the world's changeableness, time and eternity, space and soul, pride and physicality versus love. <em>Bellefleur</em> is an allegory of caritas versus cupiditas, love and selflessness versus pride and selfishness. It is a novel of change, baffling complexity, mystery.</p><p>Written with a voluptuousness and startling immediacy that transcends Joyce Carol Oates's early works, <em>Bellefleur</em> is widely regarded as a masterwork&#x2014;a feat of literary genius that forces us "to ask again how anyone can possibly write such books, such absolutely convincing scenes, rousing in us, again and again, the familiar Oates effect, the point of all her art: joyful terror gradually ebbing toward wonder" (John Gardner).</p></p><p><p>Joyce Carol Oates is a recipient of the National Medal of Humanities, the National Book Critics Circle Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award, the National Book Award, and the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in Short Fiction, and has been several times nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. She has written some of the most enduring fiction of our time, including the national bestsellers <em>We Were the Mulvaneys</em>,<em> Blonde</em>, which was nominated for the National Book Award, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Falls</em>, which won the 2005 Prix Femina.

Sparked by his own love of heavy music and an insatiable wanderlust, Edward Banchs travels throughout South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Zimbabwe meeting the musicians and fans who, working with varying degrees of infrastructure and resources, pursue this music with a drive and passion recognizable to metal fans anywhere in the world. <p></p><p>From cafes in Madagascar to quiet, dusty towns in the middle of the Kalahari, Edward seeks to understand exactly how the musicians live and struggle &#x2013; while experiencing the passion of rock and metal in Africa for himself.

In the title story, Levi demonstrates his unerringly tragic understanding of the fragility of the universe through the tale of a pensive astronomer, terrified by the possibility that a long-dormant star might explode and reduce the entire planet to vapor. This remarkable new collection affirms Italo Calvino's conviction that Levi was "one of the most important and gifted writers of our time."</p><p><p><strong>Primo Levi</strong> (1919&#x2013;1987) was an Italian chemist and writer, best known for his memoirs <em>If This Is a Man</em> and <em>The Periodic Table</em>.</p><p><strong>Ann Goldstein</strong>, the editor of <em>The Complete Works of Primo Levi</em> and the award-winning translator of Elena Ferrante&#x2019;s novels, is a former editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p><p>Alessandra Bastagli is the translator of Primo Levi's stories in <em>A Tranquil Star</em> and his essays in <em>The Complete Works</em>. She lives in New York.</p>Primo Levi, the Italian Jewish chemist and writer who died 20 years ago, is best known for his 1959 memoir Survival in Auschwitz. But this new collection of stories -- all previously unpublished in English -- will surely surprise readers familiar with Levi as a "Holocaust writer" or even those who know the semi-autobiographical stories in The Periodic Table. A Tranquil Star is a cabinet of curiosities, in which the realistic pieces are ordinary compared to the array of fascinating items Levi has culled from his imagination of worlds beyond our own.<p>In "Bureau of Vital Statistics," for instance, a frustrated man reports to his office for what appears to be an ordinary clerical position, until we slowly realize that his job is to assign causes of death to people on Earth. In "Gladiators," a woman reluctantly agrees to join her boyfriend at a popular sporting event -- where the "sport" consists of pedestrians dueling against cars. "Knall" describes a consumer craze for a pocket-sized gadget that instantly and silently murders people, but only at point-blank range.</p><p>Each of these stories is only a few pages long, and perhaps it's best to reveal as little about them as possible, so as not to ruin the reader's delight upon discovering the moment when the surreal finally saturates the real.</p><p>For another writer, this sort of "punch line" approach to plot might become little more than a gimmick. But the cumulative effect of these stories -- each written in the same elegant, unpretentious prose that defined Levi's memoirs -- is to make one wonder about the prevailing philosophy that brought these many imagined worlds into a single mind. And as one reads, that philosophy becomes clear. In each story we are introduced to a twist on our world that is, on closer examination, not really a twist at all. The shocking elements of these stories are precisely the points where they correspond to our own world: the sick spectacle that we make of brutal violence, the casual possibility of murder based on whim, the systems of terror and war that knowingly set the causes of others' deaths.</p><p>As a collection of nearly all of Levi's previously untranslated fiction, this book does include the occasional tale in which inanity trumps insight.</p><p>But the most poignant stories here are those that deal with the act of writing itself, and in particular its failure to meet the expectation of immortality. As the narrator relates in "The Fugitive," about a poem that physically eludes its author's grasp, "To compose a poem that is worth reading and remembering is a gift of destiny: it happens to only a few people, without regard for rules or intentions, and to them it happens only a few times in their lives." Levi has been granted this gift of destiny, and American readers now have the gift of rediscovering it.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

But the abbey&#x2019;s greatest secret is the priceless jewel it conceals somewhere within its cloisters&#x2014;an heirloom that hides a treacherous past that Lori&#x2019;s fellow guests can&#x2019;t wait to get their hands on. Only Aunt Dimity&#x2019;s indispensable wisdom can help Lori unravel a mystery that is&nbsp; considerably thicker than the accumulating snow in this page-turning treat.<br></p></p><p>Nancy Atherton is the bestselling author of twenty-two Aunt Dimity Mysteries. The first book in the series,&nbsp;<i>Aunt Dimity's Death</i>, was voted "One of the Century's 100 Favorite Mysteries" by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. She lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.The holidays nearly killed me. While my clever lawer husband used work as an excuse to avoid all but the most pressing social engagements, I flung myself at Christmas with the carefree abandon of a lemming rushing headlong toward a cliff.<p>While Bill barricaded himself behind legal files in our honey-colored cottage, I volunteered for every committee and attended every party given in or near Finch, the tiny English village we'd called home for the past six years. I adorned St. George's Church with evergreen boughs, warbled carols on a multitude of unsuspecting doorsteps, constructed scenery for the nativity play, prepared our four-year-old twin sons for their stage debuts as singing shepherds, baked enough angel cookies to choke a reindeer, and gave nearly as many parties for children as well as adults as I attended.</p><p>Even when the holidays were over, even when we flew to Boston in January for our annual visit with Bill's family, I couldn't shake the tinsel from my hair. While Bill spent his days enjoying cozy chats before the fire with his delightful father, I took the twins sledding and skating and sleigh-riding and compounded my folly by whisking Bill off on sentimental journeys to revisit old friends and dine out in favorite restaurants every evening.</p><p>By the time we returned to the cottage in mid-February, I was a burnt-out husk of my formerly jolly self. I winced when our sons burst into song, my gorge rose at the thought of nibbling another angel cookie, and I could scarcely bring myself to repack our Christmas decorations because the mere sight of them made my head throb. I was, in short, the pitiful victim of a self-induced holiday hangover.</p><p>Emma Harris had no trouble diagnosing my condition. As my closest neighbor and dearest friend in England she'd seen it all before, and when she found me lying listlessly on the bamboo chaise longue beneath the apple tree in my back garden, she knew exactly what had happened.</p><p>Appearances notwithstanding, I wasn't merely lounging. Since Bill was catching up on paperwork at his office in Finch, and Annelise, the twins' saintly nanny, was spending the afternoon with her mother on the family farm, I'd retired to the back garden to keep a sleepy eye on Will and Rob, who were busily building highways in the well-mulched vegetable patch.</p><p>Although I wasn't prepared to receive visitors, I was always glad to see Emma, who'd strolled over from her manor house to welcome me home and bring me up to date on local gossip. As she called a cheery hello to Will and Rob and seated herself on the deck chair opposite mine, I found myself envying her vitality. It was a gorgeous day, unseasonably warm and sunny, but I could barely summon the energy to acknowledge her arrival.</p><p>Emma surveyed me critically before commenting, "You've been burning the yule log at both ends. <i>Again.</i></p><p>I hung my head, knowing what she would say next.</p><p>"What happened to the simple family Christmas you raved about?" she asked, right on cue. "What happened to staying at home and making angel cookies"</p><p>"Please don't mention angel cookies," I muttered as my stomach whimpered.</p><p>"and singing carols around your own hearth?" Emma went on. "What happened to a simple Christmas in the cottage with Bill and the boys?"</p><p>"Bill stayed in the cottage," I reminded her, "but the boys and I kind of didn't." I held a hand out to her pleadingly. "I can't help it, Emma. I'm addicted to holly. When sleigh bells ring I lose my head. I can't keep myself from hopping up next to Santa and grabbing the reins. It's a fun ride, truly it is, and Will and Rob loved every minute of it."</p><p>"I'm sure they did," said Emma. "But you're a wreck."</p><p>"I'm not the perkiest elf on the block," I admitted.</p><p>"You're about as perky as a tree stump." Emma pursed her lips and gazed thoughtfully toward the meadow beyond the garden wall. A pleasant silence ensued, a silence that was suddenly shattered by the sharp snap of her fingers as she exclaimed, "I know what'll pull you out of your funk!"</p><p>"A large box of chocolates?" I murmured.</p><p>"No. Not chocolates." Emma got to her feet, took two paces, and turned to face me. "You're going for a walk."</p><p>I sank deeper into the cushioned chaise longue. "I'd prefer the chocolates."</p><p>Emma shook her head decisively. "You have to give energy to get energy," she said. "I'm not talking about running a marathon, Lori. I'm talking about a stroll through some lovely countryside. Solitude, fresh air, and communion with nature that's what you need."</p><p>I gazed pointedly at the apple tree's bare branches. "Not much nature to commune with, this time of year."</p><p>"You'd be surprised," said Emma. "If you're lucky you'll see rabbits, deer, woodpeckers, owls maybe even a few foxes. And the early lambing is underway." She took an invigorating breath and let it out in a whoosh. "There's nothing like the sight of a gamboling lamb to refresh the spirits."</p><p>"Do lambs gambol in snow?" I inquired dryly. "I mean, Emma, it's <i>February.</i> Last I heard, February wasn't considered the balmiest month of the year in jolly old En&lt;\h&gt;gland."</p><p>"It hasn't been so bad this year." Emma swept a hand toward the clear blue sky. "We haven't had a drop of rain or a flake of snow since December, and the meteorologists predict that the fine weather will last till the end of the month."</p><p>"I can't disappear for the rest of the month," I protested.</p><p>"How about one day, then?" Emma proposed. "Surely you can manage to escape for one day. Bill won't mind, and Annelise is more than capable of looking after the boys while you're gone."</p><p>"Let me think about it," I said, nestling my head into the cushions.</p><p>Emma regarded me sternly. "You're not doing the twins any good, sitting there like a lump."</p><p>I knew that my best friend was taking advantage of my tender maternal instincts by inserting the boys into the conversation, but I also knew that she was telling the truth. Will and Rob deserved a wide-awake and active mummy, a mummy who would get down in the dirt and play trucks with them, not a Drowsy Drusilla, yawning at them from the sidelines. Perhaps a walk <i>would</i> wake me up. Perhaps the sight of gamboling lambs <i>would</i> refresh my spirits. If nothing else, it would get me off of the chaise longue.</p><p>Emma must have sensed an opening in my defenses because she began to press her case. "I've got the perfect trail for you. I hiked it last summer. It's easy terrain, the path's well-marked, and it's not far from here. You can stop along the way for a picnic lunch. I'll drop you off at the trail head and be waiting for you when you reach the other end."</p><p>"Why don't you come along?" I suggested.</p><p>"Because you need peace and quiet, that's why." Emma resumed her seat. "We've hiked together before, Lori. I know what you're like on the trail. Talk, talk, talk, from beginning to end. You need a break from people, and that includes me."</p><p>I was forced to admit that she had a point. Emma and I had much in commonlike me, she was a transplanted Yank with two children but there were differences as well. Emma's husband was English, for one thing, while Bill was American. Her children were nearly grown, whereas mine weren't quite finished being babies. She weighed every decision carefully, while I tended to be a bit impulsive. And although we were the best of friends, we weren't the best of hiking companions.</p><p>To me, a hike was a chance to release the mind and engage the senses. I loved to ramble aimlessly, savoring whatever surprises nature had in store for me along the way. I believed that <i>lost</i> was a relative term because all trails led somewhere, particularly in England,which was, after all, a very crowded little island where you could scarcely walk ten steps without tripping over a pub, a farmhouse, or a charming village. I'd gotten lost so often that Emma had, only half-jokingly, offered to attach a homing device to my day pack, but I'd refused. Getting lost on a beautiful spring day was, for me, part of the fun.</p><p>Emma, on the other hand, belonged to the map-and-compass crowd. She owned a veritable library of Ordnance Survey maps and never left home without a half dozen in her day pack. To Emma, hiking was an intellectual activity, a mission to be accomplished, a puzzle to be solved. While on the trail, she seemed to spend more time studying maps than gazing upon the natural beauty surrounding her. If she got lost which she did, even when I wasn't around to distract her with talk, talk, talk she felt she'd failed. It seemed to me that the only advantage her method of navigation had over mine was that, at the end of the day, she could figure out exactly where she'd gone wrong.</p><p>The more I thought about it, the more I agreed with Emma: If the proposed walk was to have any beneficial effects, it would best be taken without her company.</p><p>"How long is this trail of yours?" I asked.</p><p>"Nine miles, give or take a few hundred yards," Emma replied. "You'll be able to manage it in five hours, six at the most. I'll pack your lunch for you," she offered. "I'll even pack your day pack."</p><p>I smiled. "Be sure to tuck in a few hundred maps, will you? In case I end up in Borneo or Venezuela"</p><p>"I'll put in a map of the trail." Emma leaned forward and patted my arm. "But I promise you, you won't get lost this time. Honestly, it's a simple, straightforward route. I'll show it to you on the map. There's only one turning, and," she sailed on, blithely uttering the curse that had doomed travelers for centuries, "you can't miss it."</p><p>Her enthusiasm was so infectious that the curse drifted past me, unnoticed, and in all innocence I agreed to spend a day hiking her straightforward trail, providing Bill agreed that he could live without me for five hours (six at the most). I paid no attention whatsoever to the tiny voice screaming in the back of my mind, warning me that a simple walk could be every bit as treacherous as a simple Christmas.</p></p><h2>The Soul-Winner&#39;s Handy Guide</h2><p>Used.

As all of Walter Brueggemann's writing is, the chapters are deeply biblical while also concerned with the identities, practices, and obligations of religious communities in contemporary contexts within the United States. Brueggemann consistently attempts to weave the biblical texts--vested as they are with the authority of a storyteller--into the deep contours of his readers' experiences, in order to foster a tenacious solidarity that might overcome both the psychic numbness cultivated by a 24-hour news cycle as well as the anxious possessiveness nurtured by so many privatized spiritualities.</p><p>Brueggemann brings the "transformative potential" of the biblical texts to bear on critical contemporary contexts, including but not limited to economic disparities, racial injustice and white supremacy, climate and care for creation, and the power of memory and mentoring. He delves deeply in the Psalms, which he says, "provides a foundational script for living into the fullest and deepest realities of human existence." And he draws from the Prophets his foundational concept of totalism, which he defines as "automated fragmentation of social life such that we habitually and callously disregard our relations with others."</p></p><p><p><b>Walter Brueggemann</b> is William Marcellus McPheeters Professor of Old Testament Emeritus at Columbia Theological Seminary and the author of numerous books including, from Fortress Press, <i>The Prophetic Imagination</i>,<i>Theology of the Old Testament</i> and <i>The Creative Word</i>.</p><p><b>Davis Hankins</b> is an assistant professor of religious studies in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC.</p><p>"With an inquisitive eye, an invincible passion for truth and honesty, and a crackling imagination, Brueggemann invites us to think more deeply--in accord with the 'transformational potential' of the biblical witness--about contemporary social, political, and economic issues that would deny our agency and steal our hope for a better world. Who better to lead us into a tenacious solidarity with the God who lives in and beyond scripture than Walter Brueggemann. He has himself long been an exemplar of provocative testimony; we readers have long been and shall remain his grateful students." --Samuel E. Balentine, Union Presbyterian Seminary</p> <p>"<em>Tenacious Solidarity</em> is a godsend. It's a call to an ethic of steadfast love that communities and individuals must exhibit. It shows that we are in solidarity with God through our loving obedience and in solidarity with others through mercy, compassion, and justice. Brueggemann writes in profound response to the Bible, clearly and eloquently developing an ethic of selflessness, goodness, justice, restoration, and mercy, giving incredible insight into questions of how to live alongside one another. His exposition is as instructional as it is enlightening--as always. For those of us who humbly try to be and occasionally are in the tradition of the biblical prophetic tradition, Walter is our teacher--a teacher for those whose vocation is prophetic imagination." --Jim Wallis, editor-in-chief of <em>Sojourners</em>, author of <em>America's Original Sin: Racism, White Privilege, and the Bridge to a New America</em></p> <p>"Tenacious solidarity indeed! Both words well describe Walter Brueggemann's entire career, not just this latest collection of essays--once again admirably edited and introduced by his major interpreter, Davis Hankins. These remarkable provocations range widely across our most urgent, pressing, and relevant issues: racism, the economy, the environment, and totalism. Brueggemann's profound, magisterial, and native fluency in Scripture is as much on display here as in any one of his countless other books. While he notes in the front matter that this collection may be his last outing, his faithful followers will pray that isn't the case. Either way, and despite his avoidance of the prophetic moniker, I, for one, am immediately reminded of the words of Deuteronomy 34:10: 'Never has a prophet arisen like Moses.'" --Brent A. Strawn, Emory University</p> <p>"With his characteristic skill and wisdom, Walter Brueggemann demonstrates again in this collection of recent essays the generative and transformative potentials of biblical texts to name and confront urgent challenges of our time. His interpretations model a compelling dialogue between biblical texts, interdisciplinary scholarship, and incisive, contemporary social, political, and economic analyses. The result utterly captures the imagination and urges and inspires the building of a far more welcoming, forgiving, generous, and sustainable future together." --Christine Roy Yoder, Columbia Theological Seminary</p> <p>"I was taught to preach with the Bible in one hand and the newspaper in the other. It was faithful advice. Of course, there are times (like now) when a steady tide of distressing newspaper headlines can overwhelm even the most biblically savvy of preachers. Do not fear, says Walter Brueggemann, pointing calmly to the book in our other hand. <em>Tenacious Solidarity</em> is unmatched in rifling through Scripture's pages and finding there wisdom and courage for the living of these days." --Scott Black Johnston, pastor of Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church </p></p><h2>The Quick-Reference Guide to Counseling Women</h2><p>The newest addition to the popular Quick-Reference Guide collection, <i>The Quick-Reference Guide to Counseling Women</i> focuses on the special needs of women in counseling situations.

She is best known for&nbsp;<i>Little Women</i>&nbsp;(1968), which is loosely based on her own life and proved to be one of the most popular children&#x2019;s books ever written. Three sequels followed:&nbsp;<i>Good Wives</i>&nbsp;(1869),&nbsp;<i>Little Men </i>(1871), and&nbsp;<i>Jo&#x2019;s Boys</i>&nbsp;(1886). Alcott was the daughter of the famous transcendentalist Bronson Alcott and was friend of Emerson and Thoreau. In addition to writing, she worked as a teacher, governess, and Civil War nurse, as well as being an advocate of abolition, women&#x2019;s rights, and temperance. She died in 1888 and is buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts.Chapter One: Nat CHAPTER ONE Nat <br>&#x201c;PLEASE, SIR, IS THIS PLUMFIELD?&#x201d; asked a ragged boy of the man who opened the great gate at which the omnibus left him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes; who sent you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Laurence. I have got a letter for the lady.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right; go up to the house, and give it to her; she&#x2019;ll see to you, little chap.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man spoke pleasantly, and the boy went on, feeling much cheered by the words. Through the soft spring rain that fell on sprouting grass and budding trees, Nat saw a large square house before him&#x2014;a hospitable-looking house, with an old-fashioned porch, wide steps, and lights shining in many windows. Neither curtains nor shutters hid the cheerful glimmer; and, pausing a moment before he rang, Nat saw many little shadows dancing on the walls, heard the pleasant hum of young voices, and felt that it was hardly possible that the light and warmth and comfort within could be for a homeless &#x201c;little chap&#x201d; like him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope the lady <i>will</i> see to me,&#x201d; he thought; and gave a timid rap with the great bronze knocker, which was a jovial griffin&#x2019;s head.<br> <br>A rosy-faced servant-maid opened the door, and smiled as she took the letter which he silently offered. She seemed used to receiving strange boys, for she pointed to a seat in the hall, and said, with a nod,&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit there and drip on the mat a bit, while I take this in to missis.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nat found plenty to amuse him while he waited, and stared about him curiously, enjoying the view, yet glad to do so unobserved in the dusky recess by the door.<br> <br>The house seemed swarming with boys, who were beguiling the rainy twilight with all sorts of amusements. There were boys everywhere, &#x201c;up-stairs and down-stairs and in the lady&#x2019;s chamber,&#x201d; apparently, for various open doors showed pleasant groups of big boys, little boys, and middle-sized boys in all stages of evening relaxation, not to say effervescence. Two large rooms on the right were evidently school-rooms, for desks, maps, blackboards, and books were scattered about. An open fire burned on the hearth, and several indolent lads lay on their backs before it, discussing a new cricket-ground, with such animation that their boots waved in the air. A tall youth was practicing on the flute in one corner, quite undisturbed by the racket all about him. Two or three others were jumping over the desks, pausing, now and then, to get their breath, and laugh at the droll sketches of a little wag who was caricaturing the whole household on a blackboard.<br> <br>In the room on the left a long supper-table was seen, set forth with great pitchers of new milk, piles of brown and white bread, and perfect stacks of the shiny gingerbread so dear to boyish souls. A flavor of toast was in the air, also suggestions of baked apples, very tantalizing to one hungry little nose and stomach.<br> <br>The hall, however, presented the most inviting prospect of all, for a brisk game of tag was going on in the upper entry. One landing was devoted to marbles, the other to checkers, while the stairs were occupied by a boy reading, a girl singing lullaby to her doll, two puppies, a kitten, and a constant succession of small boys sliding down the banisters, to the great detriment of their clothes, and danger to their limbs.<br> <br>So absorbed did Nat become in this exciting race, that he ventured farther and farther out of his corner; and when one very lively boy came down so swiftly that he could not stop himself, but fell off the banisters, with a crash that would have broken any head but one rendered nearly as hard as a cannon-ball by eleven years of constant bumping, Nat forgot himself, and ran up to the fallen rider, expecting to find him half-dead. The boy, however, only winked rapidly for a second, then lay calmly looking up at the new face with a surprised &#x201c;Hullo!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hullo!&#x201d; returned Nat, not knowing what else to say, and thinking that form of reply both brief and easy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you a new boy?&#x201d; asked the recumbent youth, without stirring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nat Blake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mine&#x2019;s Tommy Bangs; come up and have a go, will you?&#x201d; and Tommy got upon his legs like one suddenly remembering the duties of hospitality.<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess I won&#x2019;t, till I see whether I&#x2019;m going to stay or not,&#x201d; returned Nat, feeling the desire to stay increase every moment.<br> <br>&#x201c;I say, Demi, here&#x2019;s a new one. Come and see to him;&#x201d; and the lively Thomas returned to his sport with unabated relish.<br> <br>At his call, the boy reading on the stairs looked up with a pair of big brown eyes, and after an instant&#x2019;s pause, as if a little shy, he put the book under his arm, and came soberly down to greet the new-comer, who found something very attractive in the pleasant face of this slender, mild-eyed boy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you seen Aunt Jo?&#x201d; he asked, as if that was some sort of important ceremony.<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen anybody yet but you boys; I&#x2019;m waiting,&#x201d; answered Nat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did Uncle Laurie send you?&#x201d; proceeded Demi, politely, but gravely.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Laurence did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He is Uncle Laurie; and he always sends nice boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nat looked gratified at the remark, and smiled, in a way that made his thin face very pleasant. He did not know what to say next, so the two stood staring at one another in friendly silence, till the little girl came up with her doll in her arms. She was very like Demi, only not so tall, and had a rounder, rosier face, and blue eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is my sister Daisy,&#x201d; announced Demi, as if presenting a rare and precious creature.<br> <br>The children nodded to one another; and the little girl&#x2019;s face dimpled with pleasure, as she said, affably,&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;ll stay. We have such good times here; don&#x2019;t we, Demi?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course, we do; that&#x2019;s what Aunt Jo has Plumfield for.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It seems a very nice place indeed,&#x201d; observed Nat, feeling that he must respond to these amiable young persons.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the nicest place in the world; isn&#x2019;t it, Demi?&#x201d; said Daisy, who evidently regarded her brother as authority on all subjects.<br> <br>&#x201c;No; I think Greenland, where the icebergs and seals are, is more interesting. But I&#x2019;m fond of Plumfield, and it <i>is</i> a very nice place to be in,&#x201d; returned Demi, who was interested just now in a book on Greenland. He was about to offer to show Nat the pictures and explain them, when the servant returned, saying, with a nod toward the parlor-door,&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right; you are to stop.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad; now come to Aunt Jo.&#x201d; And Daisy took him by the hand with a pretty protecting air, which made Nat feel at home at once.<br> <br>Demi returned to his beloved book, while his sister led the new-comer into a back room, where a stout gentleman was frolicking with two little boys on the sofa, and a thin lady was just finishing the letter which she seemed to have been re-reading.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here he is, Aunty!&#x201d; cried Daisy.<br> <br>&#x201c;So this is my new boy? I am glad to see you, my dear, and hope you&#x2019;ll be happy here,&#x201d; said the lady, drawing him to her, and stroking back the hair from his forehead with a kind hand and a motherly look, which made Nat&#x2019;s lonely little heart yearn toward her.<br> <br>She was not at all handsome, but she had a merry sort of face, that never seemed to have forgotten certain childish ways and looks, any more than her voice and manner had; and these things, hard to describe but very plain to see and feel, made her a genial, comfortable kind of person, easy to get on with, and generally &#x201c;jolly,&#x201d; as boys would say. She saw the little tremble of Nat&#x2019;s lips as she smoothed his hair, and her keen eyes grew softer, but she only drew the shabby figure nearer and said, laughing,&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am Mother Bhaer, that gentleman is Father Bhaer, and these are the two little Bhaers.&#x2014;Come here, boys, and see Nat.&#x201d;<br> <br>The three wrestlers obeyed at once; and the stout man, with a chubby child on each shoulder, came up to welcome the new boy. Rob and Teddy merely grinned at him, but Mr. Bhaer shook hands, and pointing to a low chair near the fire, said, in a cordial voice,&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;There is a place all ready for thee, my son; sit down and dry thy wet feet at once.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wet? so they are! My dear, off with your shoes this minute, and I&#x2019;ll have some dry things ready for you in a jiffy,&#x201d; cried Mrs. Bhaer, bustling about so energetically, that Nat found himself in the cozy little chair, with dry socks and warm slippers on his feet, before he would have had time to say Jack Robinson, if he had wanted to try. He said &#x201c;Thank you, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; instead; and said it so gratefully, that Mrs. Bhaer&#x2019;s eyes grew soft again, and she said something merry, because she felt so tender, which was a way she had.<br> <br>&#x201c;These are Tommy Bangs&#x2019; slippers; but he never will remember to put them on in the house; so he shall not have them. They are too big; but that&#x2019;s all the better; you can&#x2019;t run away from us so fast as if they fitted.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to run away, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; And Nat spread his grimy little hands before the comfortable blaze, with a long sigh of satisfaction.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good! Now I am going to toast you well, and try to get rid of that ugly cough. How long have you had it, dear?&#x201d; asked Mrs. Bhaer, as she rummaged in her big basket for a strip of flannel.<br> <br>&#x201c;All winter. I got cold, and it wouldn&#x2019;t get better, somehow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No wonder, living in that damp cellar with hardly a rag to his poor dear back!&#x201d; said Mrs. Bhaer, in a low tone to her husband, who was looking at the boy with a skillful pair of eyes, that marked the thin temples and feverish lips, as well as the hoarse voice and frequent fits of coughing that shook the bent shoulders under the patched jacket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Robin, my man, trot up to Nursey, and tell her to give thee the cough-bottle and the liniment,&#x201d; said Mr. Bhaer, after his eyes had exchanged telegrams with his wife&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Nat looked a little anxious at the preparations, but forgot his fears, in a hearty laugh, when Mrs. Bhaer whispered to him, with a droll look,&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hear my rogue Teddy try to cough. The syrup I&#x2019;m going to give you has honey in it; and he wants some.&#x201d;<br> <br>Little Ted was red in the face with his exertions by the time the bottle came, and was allowed to suck the spoon, after Nat had manfully taken a dose, and had the bit of flannel put about his throat.<br> <br>These first steps toward a cure were hardly completed, when a great bell rang, and a loud tramping through the hall announced supper. Bashful Nat quaked at the thought of meeting many strange boys, but Mrs. Bhaer held out her hand to him, and Rob said, patronizingly, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be &#x2019;fraid; I&#x2019;ll take care of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Twelve boys, six on a side, stood behind their chairs, prancing with impatience to begin, while the tall flute-playing youth was trying to curb their ardor. But no one sat down, till Mrs. Bhaer was in her place behind the teapot, with Teddy on her left, and Nat on her right.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is our new boy, Nat Blake. After supper you can say, How do you do? Gently, boys, gently.&#x201d;<br> <br>As she spoke every one stared at Nat, and then whisked into their seats, trying to be orderly, and failing utterly. The Bhaers did their best to have the lads behave well at meal times, and generally succeeded pretty well, for their rules were few and sensible, and the boys, knowing that they tried to make things easy and happy, did their best to obey. But there <i>are</i> times when hungry boys cannot be repressed without real cruelty, and Saturday evening, after a half-holiday, was one of those times.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dear little souls, do let them have one day in which they can howl and racket and frolic, to their hearts&#x2019; content. A holiday isn&#x2019;t a holiday, without plenty of freedom and fun; and they shall have full swing once a week,&#x201d; Mrs. Bhaer used to say, when prim people wondered why banister-sliding, pillow-fights, and all manner of jovial games were allowed under the once decorous roof of Plumfield.<br> <br>It did seem at times as if the aforesaid roof was in danger of flying off; but it never did, for a word from Father Bhaer could at any time produce a lull, and the lads had learned that liberty must not be abused. So, in spite of many dark predictions, the school flourished, and manners and morals were insinuated, without the pupils exactly knowing how it was done.<br> <br>Nat found himself very well off behind the tall pitchers, with Tommy Bangs just round the corner, and Mrs. Bhaer close by, to fill up plate and mug as fast as he could empty them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is that boy next the girl down at the other end?&#x201d; whispered Nat to his young neighbor under cover of a general laugh.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Demi Brooke. Mr. Bhaer is his uncle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What a strange name!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;His real name is John, but they call him Demi-John, because his father is John too. That&#x2019;s a joke, don&#x2019;t you see?&#x201d; said Tommy, kindly explaining. Nat did not see, but politely smiled, and asked, with interest,&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he a very nice boy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I bet you he is; knows lots and reads like any thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is the fat one next him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s Stuffy Cole. His name is George, but we call him Stuffy &#x2019;cause he eats so much. The little fellow next Father Bhaer is his boy Rob, and then there&#x2019;s big Franz his nephew; he teaches some, and kind of sees to us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He plays the flute, doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; asked Nat as Tommy rendered himself speechless by putting a whole baked apple into his mouth at one blow.<br> <br>Tommy nodded, and said, sooner than one would have imagined possible under the circumstances, &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t he, though? and we dance sometimes, and do gymnastics to music. I like a drum myself, and mean to learn as soon as ever I can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like a fiddle best; I can play one too,&#x201d; said Nat, getting confidential on this attractive subject.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you?&#x201d; and Tommy stared over the rim of his mug with round eyes, full of interest. &#x201c;Mr. Bhaer&#x2019;s got an old fiddle, and he&#x2019;ll let you play on it if you want to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Could I? Oh, I would like it ever so much. You see I used to go round fiddling with my father, and another man, till he died.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t that fun?&#x201d; cried Tommy, much impressed.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it was horrid; so cold in winter, and hot in summer. And I got tired; and they were cross sometimes; and I didn&#x2019;t have enough to eat.&#x201d; Nat paused to take a generous bite of gingerbread, as if to assure himself that the hard times were over; and then he added regretfully,&#x2014;&#x201c;But I did love my little fiddle, and I miss it.

Born and raised here, twenty-seven-year-old Cole Freeman has sidestepped work as a miner to become an aide in a nursing home. He's got a shock of bleached blond hair and a gentle touch well suited to the job. He's also a drug dealer, reselling the prescription drugs his older patients give him to a younger crowd looking for different kinds of escape. </p><p>In this economically depressed, shifting landscape, Cole is floundering. The mining corporation is angling to buy the Freeman family's property, and Cole's protests only feel like stalling. Although he has often dreamed of leaving, he has a sense of duty to this land, especially after the death of his grandfather. His grandfather is not the only loss: Cole's one close friend, Terry Rose, has also slipped away from him, first to marriage, then to drugs. While Cole alternately attempts romance with two troubled women, he spends most of his time with the elderly patients at the home, desperately trying to ignore the decay of everything and everyone around him. Only when a disaster befalls these mountains is Cole forced to confront his fears and, finally, take decisive action-if not to save his world, to at least save himself. </p><p><i>The Evening Hour </i>marks the powerful debut of a writer who brings originality, nuance, and an incredible talent for character to an iconic American landscape in the throes of change.</p></p><p><p><b>Carter Sickels, </b>a graduate of the MFA program at Pennsylvania State University, was awarded fellowships to Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, the Sewanee Writers' Conference, and the MacDowell Colony.

Thanks to rich soil, adequate rainfall, and warm summer temperatures, hundreds of species combine to produce a diverse and colorful and ever-changing landscape. Using text and maps by Paul Christiansen and newly created drawings by Mark M�ller, this first comprehensive guide to the prairie plants native to Iowa provides all the information necessary for identifying and distinguishing even the most similar species.</p> <p>Species are described from the ground up: stem, leaf, bud, flower, fruit, and habitat. The time of flowering and fruiting is given for the central part of Iowa. Where several species are closely related, a common member of the group is fully described, and the other species are compared with the first. Each species is paired with a distribution map. The superbly detailed illustrations, all of which were drawn specifically for this handbook, capture the general shape of each plant as well as its characteristic features. A guide to family identification, information about extant and restored prairies in Iowa, and a glossary are also included.</p> <p>Farmers who settled Iowa in the 1800s viewed the great green sea of grasses and wildflowers as a challenge to be replaced with cropfields and pastures. Today we realize that the prairie is an addictive, restorative, aesthetically satisfying place for study and recreation. <i>An Illustrated Guide to Iowa Prairie Plants</i> is designed to enable those who want to go beyond the most common plants to identify all native species and to learn more about their distribution, structure, and natural history.</p> <p></p></p><p>Paul Christiansen was professor of botany at Cornell College until his retirement; he remains an active teacher, writer, and ecological consultant. Mark Miller has sketched and photographed the world from Alaska to Antarctica; he is currently a freelance illustrator living on a farmstead near Iowa City.<p>&#x201c;This wonderful guide embodies the wealth of experience of Paul Christiansen, who has spent a lifetime studying Iowa prairies and prairie plants, and the talent of Mark M�ller, whose deep appreciation of this most endangered ecosystem is reflected in his remarkable illustrations. I love the logic and functionality of this guide. The species treatments are organized by family, which means that species with similar flower and plant characteristics are together, so you can quickly check the illustrations of all the species in a particular family to see whether one fits the plant you are trying to identify. To paraphrase an old adage, Mark M�ller's meticulous drawings are worth a thousand photographs. <i>An Illustrated Guide to Iowa Prairie Plants</i> celebrates a fantastic ecosystem and appropriately focuses on a state that once was encompassed by it.&#x201d;&#x2014;Diana Horton, University of Iowa Herbarium</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;For over a century, plant lovers have waited for a comprehensive guide that would lead them gently into knowledgeable companionship with Iowa's prairie flora. At last the heart of the tallgrass prairie has what it deserves: an easy-to-use manual, beautifully illustrated, with detailed structural descriptions and distribution maps. As a door for the novice and a sourcebook for the initiated, Paul Christiansen and Mark M�ller's book cannot help but increase knowledge and appreciation of Iowa's prairie remnants and thus magnify the preservation of our beleaguered but precious prairie resource.&#x201d;&#x2014;Cornelia F.

In the bitter winter of 1946, Rachael Morgan arrives with her only remaining son Edmund in the ruins of Hamburg. Here she is reunited with her husband Lewis, a British colonel charged with rebuilding the shattered city. But as they set off for their new home, Rachael is stunned to discover that Lewis has made an extraordinary decision: they will be sharing the grand house with its previous owners, a German widower and his troubled daughter. In this charged atmosphere, enmity and grief give way to passion and betrayal.<br></p></p><p>Rhidian Brook is an award-winning writer of fiction, television, and film.

His stories have appeared in <i>The Paris Review </i>and <i>New Statesman</i>. He lives in London with his wife and two children.<p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve found a house for you, sir.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Captain Wilkins stubbed out his cigarette and placed his yellowed finger on the map of Hamburg that was pinned to the wall behind his desk. He traced a line west from the pinhead marking their temporary headquarters, away from the bombed-out districts of Hammerbrook and St. Georg, over St. Pauli and Altona, towards the old fishing suburb of Blankenese, where the Elbe veered up and debouched into the North Sea. The map&#x2014;pulled from a pre-war German guidebook&#x2014;failed to show that these conurbations were now a phantom city comprised only of ash and rubble.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bloody great palace by the river. Here.&#x201d; Wilkins&#x2019;s finger circled the crook at the end of the Elbchaussee, the road running parallel to the great river. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;ll be to your taste, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The word belonged to another world: a world of surplus and civil comfort. In the last few months, Lewis&#x2019;s tastes had narrowed to a simple checklist of immediate and basic needs: 2,500 calories a day, tobacco, warmth. &#x201c;A bloody great palace by the river&#x201d; suddenly seemed to him like the demand of a frivolous king.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis had &#x201c;gone off &#x201d; again; off into that unruly parliament inside his head, a place where, more and more, he found himself in hot debate with colleagues.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there someone living in it already?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wilkins wasn&#x2019;t sure how to respond. His CO was a man of excel- lent repute with an impeccable war record, but he seemed to have these quirks, a way of seeing things differently. The young captain resorted to reciting what he had read in the manual: &#x201c;These people have little moral compass, sir. They are a danger to us and to them- selves. They need to know who is in charge. They need leadership. A firm but fair hand.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis nodded and waved the captain on, saving his words. The cold and the calories had taught him to ration these.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The house belongs to a family called Lubert. Loo-bear-t. Hard &#x2018;T.&#x2019; The wife died in the bombings. Her family were bigwigs in the food trade. Connections with Blohm and Voss. They also owned a series of flour mills. Herr Lubert was an architect. He&#x2019;s not been cleared yet but we think he&#x2019;s a probable white or, at worst, an acceptable shade of grey; no obvious direct Nazi connections.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bread.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis had not eaten all day and had taken the short leap from &#x201c;flour mill&#x201d; to bread without thinking; the bread he pictured in his head was suddenly more present, more real, than the captain stand- ing at the map on the other side of the desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go on&#x2014;the family.&#x201d; Lewis made an effort to look as if he was listening, nodding and setting his jaw at an inquisitive tilt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wilkins continued: &#x201c;Lubert&#x2019;s wife died in &#x2019;43. In the firestorm. One child&#x2014;a daughter. Freda, fifteen years old. They have some staff&#x2014;a maid, a cook and a gardener. The gardener is a first-rate handyman&#x2014;ex-Wehrmacht. The family have some relatives they can move in with. We can billet the staff, or you can take them on. They&#x2019;re clean enough.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The process by which the soul-sifters of the Control Commis-sion&#x2019;s Intelligence Branch assessed cleanliness was the Fragebogen, or questionnaire: 133 questions to determine the degree of a German citizen&#x2019;s collaboration with the regime. From this, they were categorized into three colour-coded groups&#x2014;black, grey and white, with intermediate shades for clarity&#x2014;and dispatched accordingly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re expecting the requisition. It&#x2019;s just a matter of you viewing the place then turfing them out. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll be disappointed, sir.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think they will be disappointed, Captain?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Luberts? When I turf them out.&#x201d; &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not allowed the luxury of disappointment, sir. They&#x2019;re Germans.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course. How silly of me.&#x201d; Lewis left it there. Any more such questions and this efficient young officer with his shiny Sam Browne and perfect puttees would have him reported to Psychiatric.<br> &nbsp;<br> He stepped from the overheated British Military Detachment Headquarters into the premature cold of a late-September day. He blew vapour and pulled on the kid gloves that Captain McLeod, the American cavalry officer, had given him in the town hall at Bremen the day the Allies had announced the division lines of the new Germany. &#x201c;Looks like you get the bum deal,&#x201d; he had said, reading the directive. &#x201c;The French get the wine, we get the view and you guys get the ruins.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis had lived among the ruins for so long now he had stopped noticing them. His uniform was fitting garb for a governor in this new, quadripartite Germany&#x2014;a kind of internationalized mufti which, in the midst of post-war disorientation and re-regulation, passed without comment.<br> &nbsp;<br> The American gloves were prized but it was his Russian-front sheepskin coat that gave him the most pleasure, its provenance traceable back via the American to a Luftwaffe lieutenant who had, in turn, taken it from a captured Red Army colonel. He&#x2019;d be wearing it soon enough if this weather kept up.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a relief to get away from Wilkins. The young officer was one of the new brigade of civil servants that made up the Control Commission, Germany, a bloated force of clipboard men who saw themselves as the architects of the reconstruction. Few of these people had seen action&#x2014;or even a German&#x2014;and this allowed them to pronounce and theorize their way to decisions with confidence. Wilkins would make major before long.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis took a silver-plated cigarette case from his coat and opened it, catching the light from the sun on its clear, buffed surface. He polished it regularly. The case was the only material treasure he had with him, a parting gift from Rachael given to him at the gates of the last proper house he&#x2019;d lived in&#x2014;in Amersham, three years ago. &#x201c;Think of me when you smoke&#x201d; was her instruction, and this he had tried to do, fifty, sixty times a day for three years; a little ritual to keep the flame of love alive. He lit a cigarette and thought about that flame. With distance and time it had been easy to make it seem hotter than it was. The remembrance of their lovemaking and of his wife&#x2019;s olive-smooth, curvy flesh had sustained him through the cold and lonely months (her flesh seemingly growing smoother and curvier as the war went by). But he had grown so comfortable with this imagined, ersatz version of his wife that the imminent prospect of actually touching and smelling her unsettled him.<br> &nbsp;<br> A sleek black Mercedes 540K with a British pennant on the bon- net pulled up in front of the steps of the headquarters. The Union Jack at the wing mirror was the only thing that looked out of place. Despite its associations, Lewis liked this vehicle, its lines and the silky purr of its engine. It was appointed like an ocean-going liner, and the ultra-careful driving style of his driver&#x2014;Herr Schroeder&#x2014; added to the impression of it being like a ship. No amount of British insignia could de-Germanize this car, though. British military personnel were built for the bumbling, bulbous Austin 16, not these brute-beautiful, world-conquering machines.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis walked down the steps and gave his driver a half-salute.<br> &nbsp;<br> Schroeder, a reedy, unshaven man wearing a black cap and cape, leapt from the driver&#x2019;s seat and walked briskly round to the rear passenger door. He bowed once in Lewis&#x2019;s direction and, with a flourish of his cape, opened the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The front seat is fine, Herr Schroeder.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Schroeder seemed agitated at Lewis&#x2019;s self-demotion. &#x201c;Nein, Herr Kommandant.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Really. Sehr gut,&#x201d; Lewis repeated. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bitte, Herr Oberst.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Schroeder clunked the rear door shut and held up a hand, still not wanting Lewis to lift a finger. <br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis stepped back, playing the game, but the German&#x2019;s deference depressed him: these were the motions of a defeated man clinging to patronage. Inside, Lewis handed Schroeder the scrap of paper on which Wilkins had scribbled the address of the house that was probably going to be his home for the foreseeable future. The driver squinted at it and nodded his approval of the destination.<br> &nbsp;<br> Schroeder was forced to steer a weaving course between the bomb craters that pocked the cobbled road and the rivulets of people walking in dazed, languid fashion, going nowhere in particular, carrying the remnant objects of their old lives in parcels, sacks, crates and cartons, and a heavy, almost visible, disquiet. They were like a people thrown back to the evolutionary stage of nomadic gatherers.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ghost of a tremendous noise hung over the scene. Something out of this world had undone this place and left an impossible jig- saw from which to reconstruct the old picture. There was no put- ting it back together again and there would be no going back to the old picture. This was Stunde Null. The Zero Hour. These people were starting from scratch and scratching a living from nothing. Two women pushed and pulled a horse cart stacked with furniture between them, while a man carrying a briefcase walked along as though in search of the office where he once worked without even a glance at the fantastic destruction that lay all around him, as if this apocalyptic architecture were the natural state of things.<br> &nbsp;<br> A smashed city stretched as far as the eye could see, the rubble reaching as high as the first floor of any building still standing. Hard to believe that this was once a place where people read newspapers, made cakes and thought about which pictures to hang on the walls of their front parlours. The facade of a church stood on one side of the road, with only sky for stained glass and the wind for a congregation. On the other side, apartment blocks&#x2014;intact except for the fronts, which had been completely blown off, revealing the rooms and furniture within&#x2014;stood like giant doll&#x2019;s houses. In one of these rooms, oblivious to the elements and exposure to watching eyes, a woman stood lovingly brushing a young girl&#x2019;s hair in front of a dressing table.<br> &nbsp;<br> Further along the road, women and children stood around piles of rubble, scavenging for sustenance or looking to save fragments of their past. Black crosses marked the places where bodies lay waiting to be buried. And, everywhere, the strange pipe-chimneys of a subterranean city protruded from the ground, pouring black smoke into the sky.<br></p></p><h2>42 Is Not Just a Number: The Odyssey of Jackie Robinson, American Hero</h2><p><b>An eye-opening look at the life and legacy of Jackie Robinson, the man who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball and became an American hero.</b><br><br>Baseball, basketball, football &#x2014; no matter the game, Jackie Robinson excelled. His talents would have easily landed another man a career in pro sports, but such opportunities were closed to athletes like Jackie for one reason: his skin was the wrong color. Settling for playing baseball in the Negro Leagues, Jackie chafed at the inability to prove himself where it mattered most: the major leagues. Then in 1946, Branch Rickey, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, recruited Jackie Robinson. Jackie faced cruel and sometimes violent hatred and discrimination, but he proved himself again and again, exhibiting courage, determination, restraint, and a phenomenal ability to play the game.

His approach will inspire you to trust in yourself and your own ability as you use your mind, body, and spirit, so as to begin &#x201c;living inside&#x201d; your stories in a way that brings them to life for yourself as well as your audience.<br><br>The process is simple in its structure yet profound in its impact. <i>Dramatic Circumstances</i> will prove an invaluable resource for actors, singers, teachers, directors, and anyone else who knows and believes in the power of stories to inform and touch the lives of those who tell and hear them.</p><p><b>William Wesbrooks</b> (New York, NY and Santa Fe, NM) studied psychology, theater, and music in preparation for his theatrical career, which has spanned 40 years and encompassed performing, directing, playwriting, and teaching. He is currently a music associate professor at New York University, where he serves as the director of vocal performance at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.Once upon a time, there was a professor who taught singing actors about how to perform songs. He worked in a big city at a university with a big reputation, and many students came to study with him. He loved his work; he loved being able to help students, and the things he taught them were genuinely helpful. After awhile, he thought to himself, ''Maybe I could help more students if I were to write about the ways I train my students in a book.'' <br><br> Yes, this is my story, but it's also the story of Bill Wesbrooks, Director of Vocal Performance at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development at NYU. The difference between Bill and me is, he's actually written the book. It s called ''Dramatic Circumstances,'' it was published a few months ago, and it's a great addition to the literature of singer-actor training. <br><br> Wesbrooks has written a fine book. He is an intelligent, humane teacher, dedicated to his students' growth; his calm, reassuring demeanor and generosity of spirit shine forth on every page. The work he describes in the pages of his book is important work that every singing actor needs to undertake. <br><br> It doesn't diminish Bill's accomplishment to point out that he clearly stands on the shoulders of others who have gone before him; the same can be said for nearly everyone in every field of endeavor. Stanislavski's influence is evident, not just in the types of work and the procedures that Bill encourages his students to employ, but in the way he has chosen to present much of his work in the form of dialog between teacher and student, much as Stanislavski did. The seminal work of David Craig, especially his 1978 book ''On Singing Onstage,'' also appears to have influenced Wesbrooks approach; the forensic gathering of information from the song s text that Craig calls the ''One'' and the personalized ''This is a story about me'' approach employed in his ''Two'' are a foundation on which Wesbrooks has skillfully built. <br><br> This is a book which other teachers of singing acting will want to study, so they can incorporate Wesbrooks' ''dramatic circumstances process'' in their own studio practice. Students will also benefit from his lessons, providing they take the time to peruse the material thoughtfully and put it into practice methodically. We are, I fear, a quick-fix culture, one reliant on the charismatic influence of experts, and Wesbrooks' approach is not a hard-sell one. I admire that about his book, but I don t know whether it will win him many acolytes. --The SAVI Singing Actor</p><h2>Arizona (Lucky Luke)</h2><p>Some of the early adventures of the lonesome cowboy.<br><br>A gang operating around Nugget City is attacking stage coaches to steal gold shipments.

Although much has been written about him and his contributions (culminating in Gary Lynch&#x2019;s magisterial biography of him, Tom Blake: The Uncommon Journey of a Pioneer Waterman, published in 2001), very little work has been done on Tom Blake&#x2019;s Einsteinian philosophy. This is a shame, since though Blake was not formally educated (he never graduated high school due to the devastating influenza epidemic that swept the world in 1918 and 1919), he was an astute observer of nature and had a deep understanding of science and its implications on such perennial questions concerning ethics, God, and the goal of human life. The essence of Tom Blake&#x2019;s philosophical outlook is best captured in his book, Voice of the Atom, an engaging narrative that centers on his conversations with a young nomadic wanderer named Anthony. Yet, there are also other scattered writings, particularly letters that he wrote to friends over the years, that provide a wider glimpse into Blake&#x2019;s thinking that are invaluable. Tom Blake was not a man of many words, but what he did write, occasionally in terse and epigrammatic phrases, are pregnant with meaning. As such, they offer us a tantalizing clue behind this enigmatic man, who in the course of a somewhat lonely existence influenced the lives of millions who mimicked Tom Blake&#x2019;s lifestyle, even as they remained oblivious to his reasoning behind it. This small book touches upon Tom Blake's Atomic Philosophy, Circle of Compassion, and Surfing Lifestyle. It also includes Albert Einstein's original 1905 paper "Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy-Content"? which formed the fundamental basis of Tom Blake's spiritual outlook. In addition, we have included the essay, "The Big Kahuna's Dilemma: How to Live in a Darwinian Universe," which was influenced by Tom Blake and Charles Darwin.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Book of Chinese Medicine: A holistic Approach to Physical, Emotional and Mental Health</h2><p><p>The Complete Book of Chinese Medicine is the result of years of research and study by a world renowned Shaolin Grandmaster, Sifu Wong Kiew Kit, who has an excellent track record in curing many so-called incurable diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, sexual inadequacy, kidney failure, rheumatism and asthma using chi kung therapy.</p><p>The aim of this exciting book is to introduce the wonderful and unique concept behind Chinese medicine.

The notes of any solo are only half the story; the other, equally crucial element is the rhythm. Though there are leagues of books teaching you the scales, modes, and arpeggios that are used when soloing, there&#39;s been a great void in the available material with regards to teaching the concept of rhythm. We don&#39;t instinctually possess knowledge of which notes to use, so why would we instinctually know which rhythms to use when playing these notes? This is where Rhythmic Lead Guitar comes into play. In this book, you&#39;ll learn the timing of notes from the ground up, helping you to develop a solid, internal sense of rhythm that will stick with you throughout your career.

This psychoanalytical explanation fails to take account of the research I&#x2019;ve done in the function of the brains of both mother and child during childbirth, working with gynecologists like Kees Boer at Amsterdam&#x2019;s Academic Medical Center. The conclusion of Boer&#x2019;s PhD thesis was that smooth childbirth requires good interaction between the brains of mother and child.<br><br>Both brains play a role in speeding up labor by secreting a hormone, oxytocin, into the bloodstream that makes the uterus contract. The mother&#x2019;s biological clock imposes a day-�night rhythm on the birth process, which explains why most children are born during the quiet phase, at night and in the early hours of the morning. That&#x2019;s also the time when birth progresses fastest and requires the least assistance.<br><br>Labor starts when the baby&#x2019;s blood sugar level starts to drop&#x2014;� a sign that the mother can no longer provide the growing child with sufficient nourishment. Michel Hofman has calculated that labor is triggered at a stage when the child accounts for around 15 percent of the mother&#x2019;s metabolism. That point is reached earlier by twins, triplets, and so on, which is why they are born prematurely. While still in the womb, the brain cells in the child&#x2019;s hypothalamus respond to a drop in blood sugar level in the same way that they later respond to a lack of food in adulthood, by stimulating the stress axis. This induces a series of hormonal changes, making the uterus contract (fig. 3). The contractions, stimulated by oxytocin, make the baby&#x2019;s head press against the cervix. This in turn triggers a reflex, via the mother&#x2019;s spinal cord, which causes the release of yet more oxytocin. The baby&#x2019;s head then exerts more pressure, triggering the same reflex. The child can only escape from this chain reaction by being born.<br><br>Various psychiatric disorders are associated with a difficult birth. It has long been known that a high percentage of patients with schizophrenia experienced problems at birth, such as delivery by forceps or vacuum pump, low birth weight, premature birth, premature breaking of the waters, or time spent in an incubator. It was once thought that difficult births caused brain damage, leading to schizophrenia. We now know that schizophrenia is an early developmental brain disorder largely caused by genetic factors (see chapter 10). So a difficult birth can be seen as a failure of interaction between the brains of mother and child and thus as the first symptom of schizophrenia, even though the disease doesn&#x2019;t develop fully until puberty. The same applies to autism, another early developmental brain disorder (see chapter 9) that also often goes hand in hand with birth-�related problems. Recent studies have shown that girls who suffer from the eating disorders anorexia and bulimia nervosa often had problems at birth, including low birth weight. The more numerous such problems are, the earlier eating disorders manifest themselves in young adults. One wonders whether their hypothalami started out unable to deal well with glucose levels, given that a decrease in them signals the start of labor. So here, too, birth-�related problems of this type could be seen as the first symptoms of a malfunction of the hypothalamus, later taking the form of an eating disorder.<br><br>A child with a developmental brain disorder can&#x2019;t fulfill its essential role during labor. Extremely delicate interaction is needed between mother and baby for birth to proceed well. Thinking about birth in this way takes a bit of getting used to because it means that a child&#x2019;s say in life starts right from birth.<br><br>A Difficult Birth as the First Symptom of a Developmental Brain Disorder<br><br>When there is no more food for the young in the egg and it has nothing on which to live it makes violent movements, searches for food, and breaks the membranes. In just the same way, when the child has grown big and the mother cannot continue to provide him with enough nourishment, he becomes agitated, breaks through the membranes, and incontinently passes into the external world, free from any bonds.<br><br>Hippocrates<br><br>In one-�third of cases, brain disorders that manifest themselves as a child develops are wrongly ascribed to a difficult birth. In fact, the brain defects that cause such conditions as learning disabilities and spasticity often come into being long before birth.<br><br>The English surgeon William John Little is credited as the first person to identify spastic diplegia (a form of cerebral palsy), having described the condition in forty-�seven children in 1862. His conviction that it was caused by birth trauma is still held by many to this day. Strangely enough, little attention has been paid to the opposing view held by Sigmund Freud, who, after a careful study in 1897, concluded that a difficult birth couldn&#x2019;t cause spasticity but that both the neurological condition and the difficult birth should be seen as the consequence of a developmental disorder of the fetal brain. Problems at birth are often also blamed in the case of children with learning disabilities. Prader-�Willi syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes morbid obesity over the course of time (see chapter 5). Many children with this syndrome have a difficult birth and go on to have learning disabilities. These aren&#x2019;t caused by birth-�related problems but by the genetic abnormality that was present from conception.<br><br>In only 6 percent of children born at due date with spasticity and a mere 1 percent of children with learning disabilities can the disorder be attributed to a lack of oxygen at birth. The vast majority of children with these conditions experience problems long before birth, as is evident from their slow growth and lack of movement in the womb. Spasticity has many different causes, ranging from genetic abnormalities and intrauterine infections to exposure to chemicals, iodine deficiency, and long-�term oxygen deficiency in the womb. Conversely, it&#x2019;s striking that serious brain damage often does not result when a normal fetus is suddenly deprived of oxygen at birth, as Freud already noted. To understand why he was right, you need to be aware of the active role played by the fetus in the birth process. Its brain plays a crucial part, both in initiating labor and during its course. The relationship between a difficult labor and impaired brain function is usually the opposite of what is generally assumed. A difficult labor or premature or delayed labor tends to be the consequence of a problem in fetal brain development. And that deficiency can in turn be caused by genetic factors, lack of oxygen in the womb, infections, or exposure to medication or addictive substances ingested by the mother, like morphine, cocaine, or nicotine. So efforts to establish the cause of premature or difficult birth are incomplete without examining the child&#x2019;s brain.<br><br>That a child&#x2019;s brain plays a very active role in labor is something we established thirty-�five years ago, in a study with the gynecologist W. J. Honnebier. We looked at the births of 150 anencephalic infants (children born with most of their brain missing, fig. 4). Babies with this condition are usually born extremely prematurely or very overdue, and labor proceeds much more slowly than normal. That birth takes twice as long (and the birth of the placenta three times as long) is due to the absence of oxytocin in the child&#x2019;s brain. Half of these babies don&#x2019;t survive, which shows how important a well-�functioning fetal brain is to the process of labor. Another hormone secreted by the fetal brain, vasopressin, ensures that blood is mainly directed to those organs that are crucial to survival during birth, like the heart, the adrenal gland, the pituitary gland, and the brain. This involves depriving less vital areas like the intestines. Animal studies have revealed the many complex chemical steps that are necessary for the birth process. But it all starts when a child&#x2019;s brain registers that the maternal food supply is becoming inadequate, causing it to give the signal for the onset of labor, just as the Greek doctor and philosopher Hippocrates noted over two thousand years ago.<br><br>Maternal Behavior<br><br>Behold two horses that appear of the same size and shape: How do you know which is the mother and which the son? Give them hay. The mother will nudge the hay toward her son.<br><br>The Teachings of Buddha<br><br>A woman&#x2019;s brain starts being programmed for maternal behavior right from the onset of pregnancy. Hormones alter the brain in ways that are reinforced after the birth by the presence of the child. The changes in the mother&#x2019;s brain are long-�term, perhaps even permanent. Adults sometimes lament that the umbilical cord attaching them to their mothers has never really been cut, while mothers can be burdened by concern about their offspring well after they&#x2019;ve grown up. If something happens to their child, some will claim they felt a premonition the previous day&#x2014;�which is true, for the simple reason that they worry about their children on a daily basis.<br><br>During pregnancy the pituitary gland secretes the hormone prolactin, which prompts nesting behavior. There&#x2019;s an urge to clean the house and paint the baby&#x2019;s room. Once, when I went to check on my laboratory rats as a PhD student, I was sure that someone had swapped my cages with adult male rats for ones with pregnant rats. Each of the rats had built an enormous nest of sawdust. They were, in fact, my male rats&#x2014;�they had built the nests because the previous day I&#x2019;d given them a dose of prolactin. Similarly, during his stay in Amsterdam&#x2019;s Wilhelmina Gasthuis hospital, a male patient with a pituitary gland tumor that produced prolactin was never happier than when helping staff clean the bedside lockers.<br><br>At the end of pregnancy, both the mother&#x2019;s and the child&#x2019;s brain cells produce oxytocin and release it into the bloodstream. This hormone has many functions. Doctors use oxytocin to induce labor, and some women are given nasal spray containing oxytocin to boost milk release after giving birth. Its role at the end of pregnancy is to stimulate and speed up labor. The mother&#x2019;s brain secretes more oxytocin at night, when the uterus is most sensitive to the hormone, which encourages labor to start while the body is at rest. During labor, extra oxytocin is released when the child&#x2019;s head presses down on the cervix. This signal is passed on to the mother&#x2019;s brain via the spinal cord, triggering the release of more oxytocin to heighten labor. If a woman is given an epidural to offset labor pains, the signal no longer reaches her brain, causing her pituitary gland to release less oxytocin. In such cases women often need an oxytocin drip to restore the strength of their contractions.<br><br>After birth, oxytocin ensures that the mother secretes enough milk. When the child sucks at the nipple, it stimulates its mother&#x2019;s brain to release oxytocin, causing milk to be expressed from the mammary gland. After a time, it&#x2019;s sufficient for the child to cry to trigger this reflex. Such a strong dose of oxytocin is produced that milk spurts from the breasts&#x2014;�a potentially embarrassing state of affairs in company. Farmers have known about this reflex for centuries, having seen how milk will spurt from the cow&#x2019;s udders when they come into the cowshed rattling a milk bucket.<br><br>Studies are increasingly revealing the importance of oxytocin in many forms of social interaction. One of the new names given to it is the &#x201c;bonding hormone&#x201d; because of the tie it creates between mother and child. This process starts in late pregnancy, when oxytocin levels surge, peaking during birth. When delivery is by Caesarean section that peak does not occur, which might explain why the mother&#x2019;s brain reacts less strongly to the child&#x2019;s crying and maternal behavior takes longer to manifest itself. Nursing and playing with the child causes the mother&#x2019;s brain to be calmed by oxytocin, which also stimulates her warm interaction and close bond with the child. A mother who hasn&#x2019;t formed a close attachment to her child doesn&#x2019;t experience a rise in oxytocin levels when she plays with it. Children who grew up in an orphanage have lower levels of oxytocin in their blood than children who grew up in a family. Even three years after being adopted, children who were neglected early in their development don&#x2019;t experience a normal surge of oxytocin during affectionate bodily contact with their carers. In other words, their ability to bond is impaired on a long-�term basis, sometimes even permanently. A recent study of women who had been emotionally neglected or physically or sexually abused showed greatly reduced oxytocin levels in their cerebral fluid, causing concern that their problems would be passed on to the next generation. Oxytocin also inhibits the stress axis. When girls between the ages of seven and twelve underwent the stressful experience of giving a talk to a group of strangers, reassuring input from their mothers led to the release of oxytocin. It made no difference whether the child was cuddled or simply reassured by a telephone conversation with the mother.<br><br>These findings seem to suggest that it&#x2019;s possible to inhibit that excessive motherly concern that can be so annoying to adult children. Maternal behavior in apes was experimentally blocked with a substance that inhibited oxytocin&#x2019;s effect on the brain. It would seem to be the perfect medication for mothers who simply can&#x2019;t accept the fact that their children can function perfectly well independently. Unfortunately, however, the substance reduces apes&#x2019; interest not only in their offspring but also in sex.<br><br>Thirty years ago, our research group investigated the effect of oxytocin on the brain and behavior. We created oxytocin antibodies, staining them so that they would show up in the brain, and looked for the locations where oxytocin is produced and secreted. We found extensive networks of brain cells and axons containing oxytocin in a number of brain structures (fig. 5). Those fibers made contact with other neurons, transferring oxytocin to them in the form of a chemical messenger. Examination with an electron microscope revealed that transmission locations looked just like the synapses (cell contact points) where other chemical messengers are passed from one neuron to another (fig. 6). These form the basis for oxytocin&#x2019;s behavioral effects.</p><h2>Navajo Courts and Navajo Common Law: A Tradition of Tribal Self-Governance (Indigenous Americas)</h2><p><p>The Navajo Nation court system is the largest and most established tribal legal system in the world.

Drawing on her years of experience as a clinical psychologist, Dr Zurita Ona provides a clear and simple road map for every &#x2018;super-feeler&#x2019; on how to avoid being hijacked by your emotions. Using the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as well as aspects of positive psychology, you will learn how to distinguish between emotion-based behavior and values-based behavior so that you can step back from an uncontrolled emotional response and instead choose a more appropriate one. The result is an effective way to combat the feelings of loneliness and fear of abandonment so many super-feelers experience, as you learn to build and maintain strong healthy relationships, and to look within to identify sources of pain and struggle rather than placing outward blame. Along the way, you will become adept at skills such as self-acceptance, forgiveness, compassion, mindfulness, and conflict resolution. In the end, super-feelers will discover the truth that they are more than their emotions, and that no matter how intense the situation, they can always choose to act in a way that is consistent with their personal values, in order to experience fulfilling, loving and caring relationships.</p><p><p>Dr. <b>Patricia E.

The real problem is the government&#x2019;s well-meaning but misguided attempt to reduce the payoffs for success. </b><br>&nbsp;<br>Four years ago, Edward Conard wrote a controversial bestseller, <i>Unintended Consequences</i>, which set the record straight on the financial crisis of 2008 and explained why U.S. growth was accelerating relative to other high-wage economies. He warned that loose monetary policy would produce neither growth nor inflation, that expansionary fiscal policy would have no lasting benefit on growth in the aftermath of the crisis, and that ill-advised attempts to rein in banking based on misplaced blame would slow an already weak recovery. Unfortunately, he was right. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now he&#x2019;s back with another provocative argument: that our current obsession with income inequality is misguided and will only slow growth further. <br>&nbsp;<br>Using fact-based logic, Conard tracks the implications of an economy now constrained by both its capacity for risk-taking and by a shortage of properly trained talent&#x2014;rather than by labor or capital, as was the case historically. He uses this fresh perspective to challenge the conclusions of liberal economists like Larry Summers and Joseph Stiglitz and the myths of &#x201c;crony capitalism&#x201d; more broadly. <br>&nbsp;<br>Instead, he argues that the growing wealth of most successful Americans is not to blame for the stagnating incomes of the middle and working classes. If anything, the success of the 1 percent has put upward pressure on employment and wages.<br>&nbsp;<br>Conard argues that high payoffs for success motivate talent to get the training and take the risks that gradually loosen the constraints to growth. Well-meaning attempts to decrease inequality through redistribution dull these incentives, gradually hurting not just the 1 percent but everyone else as well. <br>&nbsp;<br>Conard outlines a plan for growing middle- and working-class wages in an economy with a near infinite supply of labor that is shifting from capital-intensive manufacturing to knowledge-intensive, innovation-driven fields. He urges us to stop blaming the success of the 1 percent for slow wage growth and embrace the upside of inequality: faster growth and greater prosperity for everyone.</p></p><p><p><b>Ed Conard</b> is the author of two top ten&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling books:&nbsp;<i>The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You&#x2019;ve Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong. </i>He is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Previously, he was a founding partner at Bain Capital, where he worked closely with former presidential candidate Mitt Romney.</p>Chapter 1<br><br>The Causes of Growing Inequality<br><br>It seems as though you can't pick up a newspaper today without reading an article blaming the 1 percent for the stagnant wages of the middle class. If people aren't accusing the 1 percent of using crony capitalism to steal what they haven't earned, then they are accusing them of inventing technology that hollows out the middle class or stifles the advancement of the underprivileged by underfunding education.<br><br>In 2003 renowned economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez burst into the public's consciousness with convincing evidence that income inequality had increased dramatically, especially in the United States, and that middle- and working-class incomes had stagnated. Their work showed that income inequality had increased not so much because of an increase in the earnings of the top 10 percent of Americans or the top 5 percent or even the top 1 percent, but chiefly among the top 1 hundredth (0.01) of 1 percent.<br><br>Demagogues and politicians favoring income redistribution were quick to link the success of the 0.1 percent to the alleged stagnant wages of the middle class. They insisted that the rich were succeeding at the expense of the rest of America. They seized on this linkage to demand higher taxes on the rich for greater income redistribution.<br><br>In his 2013 book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, for example, Piketty insisted the rich "by and large have the power to set their own remuneration, in some cases without limit and in many cases without any clear relation to their individual productivity," using nepotism, corruption, and corporate politics, or by conspiring with "hierarchical superiors." According to Piketty, the 1 percent were merely the beneficiaries of gradually eroding social norms that previously held their pay in check. Success, he claimed, was earned at the expense of the middle class. The alleged growth of CEO pay from thirty times the median wage in 1980 to over three hundred times by 2007 for the largest companies is held out as prima facie evidence.<br><br>The financial crisis of 2008 only fueled the flames of anger toward the wealthy. Banks were accused of predatory lending, the sale of fraudulent securities, and ultimately for recklessly causing the "Great Recession." The 1 percent were held responsible.<br><br>The list of allegations and complaints against the most successful Americans continued unabated. The technology they create supposedly hollows out middle- and working-class jobs. They own and manage companies that lay off employees and hire offshore workers. They are accused of failing to provide appropriate funding for education and other benefits that may alleviate poverty and increase income mobility or allow for infrastructure investments that may spark faster economic growth.<br><br>At first glance, these accusations seem reasonable. The growth of middle-class and working-class incomes has slowed. Crony capitalism does exist. Automation and offshoring seem to have reduced the number of high-paying factory jobs. Companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook scarcely seem to employ any Americans, especially not middle- and working-class Americans. Academic test scores are not improving. And it seems impossible to break the generational cycle of poverty.<br><br>Yet despite these facts, the growth of the U.S. economy has accelerated relative to other high-wage economies with more equally distributed incomes-the opposite of what one would expect if crony capitalism or other unfair means of income distribution had increased in the United States on a scale necessary to account for rising income inequality. U.S. employment grew twice as fast as employment in Germany and France since 1980. This growth has created a home for 40 million foreign-born adults, their 20 million native-born adult children, and the 20 million children of these 60 million adults.<br><br>And America has achieved this employment growth at median household incomes that are 15 to 30 percent higher than other high-wage economies, such as Germany, France, and Japan.<br><br>Careful scrutiny of the evidence reveals U.S. median household incomes have grown as fast as, or faster than, other high-wage economies. Piketty and Saez's use of tax returns instead of household income ignores the fact that an increasing number of workers live alone instead of in families with more than one worker and that an increasing portion of workers' pay is now provided as untaxed health and retirement benefits, which are difficult to measure. Middle-class tax rates have also fallen as government services have grown.<br><br>At the same time, workforce participation has fallen as Americans have grown more prosperous. Social Security and Medicare, for example, now allow older workers to retire instead of working. It's misleading to count them as households without earned income. And the demographics of the workforce have shifted toward lesser-skilled Hispanic immigrants who logically earn less than more highly skilled Americans on average. When these factors are properly considered, real wages have grown more robustly than they appear to have. And there has been no hollowing out of the middle class whatsoever. Belief that wages have stagnated nevertheless persists.<br><br>The notion that the growing success of America's 0.1 percent is the cause of slower middle- and working-class wage growth is mistaken. Entirely independent forces drive the two phenomena.<br><br>As the economy grows, it values innovation more. As such, successful innovators who achieve economy-wide success, like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, grow richer than innovators have in the past. It's simple multiplication. And they grow richer relative to doctors, schoolteachers, bus drivers, and other median-income employees whose pay is limited by the number of people, or customers, they can serve.<br><br>At the same time, information technology has opened a window of new investment opportunities and increased the productivity of the most productive workers.<br><br>Moreover, in today's knowledge-based economy, companies can scale to economy-wide success with little need for capital. Successful innovators need not share their success with investors. Successful individuals like Google's Larry Page and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg look like corporations of a bygone capital-intensive era.<br><br>Without much need for capital, start-ups become all-or-nothing lotteries. The chance for enormous payoffs attracts a larger number of more talented gamblers. More gamblers produce more outsized winners, and more innovation, too-whether the risk-adjusted returns are good, on average, or not.<br><br>Their success has compounding benefits. It provides American workers with more valuable on-the-job training, at companies like Google and Facebook, than they can get in other high-wage, slower-growing manufacturing-based economies. It creates synergistic communities of experts, like Silicon Valley. And it puts equity into the hands of successful risk-takers who use their equity and expertise to underwrite further risk-taking that produces more innovation, faster growth, and compounding benefits. Higher and more certain payoffs coupled with the growing success of others motives increased risk-taking.<br><br>No surprise, the U.S. economy has produced a disproportionate share of innovation. As a result, the nation has more income inequality but also faster employment growth at higher median incomes than other high-wage economies. Rising income inequality is the by-product of an economy that has deployed its talent and wealth more effectively than that of other economies-and not from the rich stealing from the middle and working classes.<br><br>In truth, the outsized success of America's 1 percent has been the chief source of growth exerting upward pressure on domestic employment and wages. The success of America's 1 percent is an asset, not a liability.<br><br>In the face of the evidence, it's no surprise that even Paul Krugman, a leading liberal economist, admits, "I'm actually a skeptic on the inequality-is-bad-for-performance proposition. . . . The evidence . . . is weaker than I'd like."<br><br>At the same time, a near-unlimited supply of low-skilled, low-wage workers-both offshore and immigrant-has put downward pressure on lesser-skilled wages relative to higher-skilled wages. The U.S. economy's ongoing shift from capital-intensive manufacturing to knowledge-intensive services increased the demand for properly trained talent and reduced the need for capital. Normally, the increased availability of capital would make it easier to raise the productivity and wages of lower-skilled workers. But competition from an abundance of low-wage offshore workers combined with the productivity gains it demands from domestic producers with higher-wage workers leaves a smaller and smaller share of less-skilled workers employed in highly productive capital-intensive manufacturing jobs.<br><br>Today U.S. growth demands properly trained talent and a capacity and willingness to take the risks needed to produce innovation. A shortage of properly trained talent and of the economy's capacity and willingness to take risk limit the entrepreneurial risk-taking, investment, and supervision needed to expand higher-wage, lower-skilled American employment opportunities. As a result, an influx of low-skilled immigrant workers has increased lower-wage work. In turn, the availability of low-wage immigrant workers puts downward pressure on low-skilled wages.<br><br>It's true that trade with low-wage economies lowers the cost of goods more than the wages of domestic lower-skilled labor. Were that not the case, it would be cheaper to produce goods domestically, rather than import them. But middle- and working-class workers bear 100 percent of the burden of lower wages for only a portion of the benefits of lower-priced goods. The rich, retirees, and the non-working poor also enjoy the benefits of lower-priced goods but without suffering the cost of lower wages. So while international trade benefits everyone on average, because the costs are shared disproportionately, it slows middle- and working-class wage growth relative to the growth of everyone else's income.<br><br>Growing income inequality is a real phenomenon, but a misdiagnosis of its causes and consequences leads to policies that slow growth and damage an already slow-growing economy. If the public mistakenly blames the success of the 1 percent for the stagnant wages of the middle class, while leaving the true sources of slow-growing wages-trade, trade deficits, and immigration-unaddressed, a dangerous feedback loop is likely to ensue. Raising taxes on success will reduce risk-taking and innovation. This will slow growth and reduce middle-class wages, and, in turn, increase the demand for redistribution.<br><br>Politicians who rely on middle- and working-class votes may relish this dynamic. Some may even advance the misunderstandings necessary for the problem to endure. Unfortunately, they either don't realize or don't care if they're cooking the goose that lays the golden egg.<br><br>Lower marginal tax rates would increase the payoff for successful risk-taking needed to produce innovation. Higher payoffs would motivate increased risk-taking. And increased risk-taking would have gradually compounding effects on America's ability to produce innovation-more people motivated to acquire and use the proper training, more valuable on-the-job training, growing communities of experts, and equity in the pockets of knowledgeable investors. These capabilities would magnify the value and likelihood of success. In turn, this would motivate prudent risk-taking and accelerate growth just as it has in America relative to other high-wage economies.<br><br>But unless we cut government spending, which seems highly unlikely, lower taxes would blow a huge hole in the deficit in the interim. And lower marginal tax rates would increase income inequality.<br><br>A more practical solution increases the pool of properly trained talent. America is full of high-scoring talent unwilling to endure the training and take the risks necessary to grow the economy. Their reluctance sets the price for success.<br><br>America could take a number of steps to increase its pool of properly trained talent. It could reduce subsidies to students and colleges studying curricula that do little to increase employment-psychology, history, and English, for example. There is an enormous mismatch between what high-scoring students study and what employers value. As the rest of the world trains its talent and grows increasingly competitive, America can no longer afford to waste a large share of its talent.<br><br>America needs to replace the current ethos, which discourages students from learning practical skills, with one that insists that talented people have a moral obligation to put their talents to full use serving their fellow man-whether serving them as customers or philanthropically. America could also nurture high-scoring students from low-socioeconomic families, as large numbers of these students are failing to graduate from college.<br><br>But training the next generation of students more effectively will have little effect on growth for decades, and then only with a slow compounding effect that won't fully saturate the workforce for decades after that. And like all good intentions, it is unlikely to be implemented.<br><br>In the interim, America should recruit properly trained talent from the rest of the world through more logical immigration policies. It could also recruit employers with a lower marginal corporate tax rate, perhaps by offsetting lost tax revenues with a higher tax rate on capital gains or other taxes. These steps would not only have more immediate effects but may also reduce income inequality.<br><br>In the absence of substantial changes, retiring baby boomers threaten to eat our economy alive with their unquenchable demand for retirement benefits. And China looms as a growing existential threat to national security. Neither threat appears to be solvable on its own. Embracing ultra-high-skilled immigration is America's best shot at avoiding permanent damage from these otherwise unsolvable problems.<br><br>Unless we fully understand the economics underlying growing income inequality-both the accelerating growth in the payoffs for success and the slowing growth of middle- and working-class pay-we will not understand the corresponding consequences of alternative policy changes. Without these understandings, we are likely to damage the economy rather than accelerate employment and wage growth.<br><br>So let's begin by examining the economics underlying the growing success of the 0.1 percent before turning to slowing middle-class wage growth. Then we can scrutinize alternative explanations for the facts as we find them in the second part of the book, before considering alternative proposals for change and making recommendations in the last part.<br><br>A Larger Economy Values Innovation More<br><br>While a number of economic factors drive the growing success of the 0.1 percent, this group grows richer for no other reason than the economy is growing larger. As the economy grows larger, the pool of customers grows larger. Today successful innovators, business leaders, and entertainers can serve more customers than they could have fifty years ago. As a result, the payback for economy-wide success is bigger than it used to be. An entertainer like Taylor Swift, for example, can reach a much larger market for her music than the Beatles could have in the 1960s.<br><br>Few people recognize the extent of the growth of the world economy. In 1964 the entire world economy was only as large as China's economy is today! That growth has had a big impact on the success of the most successful workers.<br><br>Over the same period, ...</p><h2>Witchcraft, Magic and Alchemy (Dover Occult)</h2><p>From raising the dead and foretelling the future to possession, curses, Kabbalah, alchemy, and more, this historical tour of the occult offers a captivating exploration of sorcery and ceremonial magic.

This path-breaking study of gender, grassroots globalization, and neoliberalism in Bangladesh looks critically at the Grameen Bank and three of the leading NGOs in the country. Amid euphoria over the benefits of microfinance, Lamia Karim offers a timely and sobering perspective on the practical, and possibly detrimental, realities for poor women inducted into microfinance operations. <br>In a series of ethnographic cases, Karim shows how NGOs use social codes of honor and shame to shape the conduct of women and to further an agenda of capitalist expansion. These unwritten policies subordinate poor women to multiple levels of debt that often lead to increased violence at the household and community levels, thereby weakening women&#x2019;s ability to resist the onslaught of market forces. <br>A compelling critique of the relationship between powerful NGOs and the financially strapped women beholden to them for capital, this book cautions us to be vigilant about the social realities within which women and loans circulate&#x2014;realities that often have adverse effects on the lives of the very women these operations are meant to help.</p><p>Lamia Karim is associate professor of cultural anthropology at the University of Oregon, Eugene.<p>"It is precisely because the microcredit mantra has been so endlessly repeated, often in place of actual empirical documentation to back its claims, that <i>Microfinance and Its Discontents</i> is so compelling.

Ryder Damien is not about to welcome this beauty with open arms, however, especially since Leah was the one who won the affection of Ryder's late father and now may inherit, his considerable wealth. But when she stands before him in the flesh -- proud, vulnerable, and intoxicatingly lovely -- desire replaces hatred in Ryder's heart. Yet can passion survive this wild land and its dangerous men...and the most breathtaking peril: untamed love?</p></p><p>Oh, what a tangled web we weave! Try to keep up, readers, as we board the roller coaster that has become beautiful Leah Barnett's life. Following her beloved mother's death the previous year, Leah inherited the Black Swan, a Boston tavern servicing sailors of color, where Leah scrapes to get by. On his deathbed, her mother's longtime lover, Louis Montague, convinces Leah to marry him in order that she might inherit the estate he abandoned when he left Colorado 30 years earlier. What Monty neglects to tell Leah until after the simple ceremony is that he abandoned two sons--half-brothers Ryder and Seth--there as well. Accompanied by Monty's best friend, Cecil Lee, Leah boards a train to Colorado to claim her bequest, enduring petty prejudices along the way. But nothing prepares Leah for her first encounter with Ryder Damien, her half-breed stepson who blames his absentee father for his illegitimate birth and his Cheyenne mother's tragic death. Determined not to care that the hostile Ryder thinks her a shameless gold digger, Leah nonetheless cannot deny his devastating attractiveness. Even Seth Montague, Monty's smooth-talking, legitimate Creole son, can't hold a candle to the longhaired Ryder. But Leah's arrival in Denver is further plagued by a 30-year-old court judgment that might cost Leah not only her inheritance, but her very freedom if she can't raise the additional money to pay off Monty's creditors. Enter Ryder, who offers to give Leah the funds she needs--if she'll give herself to him. And the dance begins!

A later article, &#39;Islamic Esoterism&#39;, has also been included, since it articulates so well the particularities of initiation in Islam by defining the fundamental elements of tasawwuf: shari&#39;ah, tariqah, haqiqah. The first constitutes the necessary fundamental exoteric basis; the second, the Way and its means; the third, the goal or final result. In the other chapters, Gu�non expresses with his usual synthetic clarity what tawhid and faqr are, and gives examples of traditional sciences, relating angelology to the Arabic alphabet, and chirology to the science of letters (&#39;ilm al-huruf). A number of book and article reviews give further insights into Islamic cosmology. Some may feel that the essay &#39;Taoism and Confucianism&#39; here included has little relevance to Sufism and Islam. However, such writers as Toshihiko Izutsu and Sachiko Murata have drawn many parallels between the two traditions. Confucianism, concentrating on social and interpersonal norms, functions as a kind of shari&#39;ah in the context of Chinese religion, while Taoism, like Sufism, is precisely the esoteric Way.</p><p>Ren� Gu�non (1886&#x2013;1951) was one of the great luminaries of the twentieth century, whose critique of the modern world has stood fast against the shifting sands of intellectual fashion. His extensive writings, now finally available in English, are a providential treasure-trove for the modern seeker: while pointing ceaselessly to the perennial wisdom found in past cultures ranging from the Shamanistic to the Indian and Chinese, the Hellenic and Judaic, the Christian and Islamic, and including also Alchemy, Hermeticism, and other esoteric currents, they direct the reader also to the deepest level of religious praxis, emphasizing the need for affiliation with a revealed tradition even while acknowledging the final identity of all spiritual paths as they approach the summit of spiritual realization. Ren� Gu�non, of whom Jacob Needleman wrote in The Sword of Gnosis that &#x2018;no other modern writer has so effectively communicated the absoluteness of truth,&#x2019; is gradually being recognized by deeper thinkers as one of the few who have truly penetrated the seductive veil of the modern age. As an expositor of pure metaphysics and its application to the science of symbols, Gu�non is without peer; and his extraordinarily prescient critique of the modern world is attracting more and more attention among cultural commentators. Little known in the English-speaking world till the recent appearance of his Collected Works in translation, Gu�non has nevertheless long been recognized as a veritable criterion of truth by a vanguard of remarkable writers who evince that rare combination: intellectuality and spirituality. After a lonely childhood, often interrupted by ill health, Gu�non navigated the seductive half-truths of occultism toward a deeper, unified vision offering a way out from the confusion and fragmentation of our time. Regarded by leading scholars as the first truly authentic interpreter of many Eastern doctrines in the West, Gu�non never tired, in face of the seemingly inexorable process of dissolution in the twentieth century, of pointing to the transcendent unity of all religious faiths and the abiding Truth that contains them all.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Against the Grain: How Agriculture Has Hijacked Civilization</h2><p><p>In this provocative, wide-ranging book, <i>Against the Grain</i>, Richard Manning offers a dramatically revisionist view of recent human evolution, beginning with the vast increase in brain size that set us apart from our primate relatives and brought an accompanying increase in our need for nourishment. For 290,000 years, we managed to meet that need as hunter-gatherers, a state in which Manning believes we were at our most human: at our smartest, strongest, most sensually alive. But our reliance on food made a secure supply deeply attractive, and eventually we embarked upon the agricultural experiment that has been the history of our past 10,000 years.</p><p>The evolutionary road is littered with failed experiments, however, and Manning suggests that agriculture as we have practiced it runs against both our grain and nature's. Drawing on the work of anthropologists, biologists, archaeologists, and philosophers, along with his own travels, he argues that not only our ecological ills-overpopulation, erosion, pollution-but our social and emotional malaise are rooted in the devil's bargain we made in our not-so-distant past. And he offers personal, achievable ways we might re-contour the path we have taken to resurrect what is most sustainable and sustaining in our own nature and the planet's.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard Manning</b> is the author of <i>Last Stand, A Good House, Grassland, One Round River, </i>and <i>Food's Frontier</i>.

All rights reserved.<br><b>AROUSAL</b><br><br>It is high summer at my mountainside home in Montana, when days are long at this latitude. The season is, if not yet desperate, at least frenzied, because we who live in the northern Rockies know that the climate makes life difficult when winter comes. The cold comes fast, so flora and fauna grab for photosynthesis or its various derivatives while they can, in a constant buzz and bustle. The observer of all this sees a race for a more prominent seat in the sun: set seed sooner, get taller faster to shade a rival, learn to grow in a bare spot no other can tolerate, secrete poisons to kill the competition, send out roots to steal water that belongs to others. The color that traces this race is green; primary producers announce their success in sucking up sun by making a display of it. The various subplots thickening among the wider cast of characters spin off the main plot played out among plants. Everything depends on the plants' success, on green. All the rest is secondary.<br><br>Mimicry, attraction, repulsion, information. These secondary dramas are a primal struggle staged in a blinding array&#x2014;the red of devil's paintbrush, the yellow of arrowleaf balsamroot, the blue of pentstemon, the gaudy flash of butterflies drawn, like me, to these colors. Too often they draw me away from the keyboard, into the hills, into the vital stories of others. Every shade signals something about food and sex, the links in every being's path to the future. Unlike me, though, the butterfly is a player on this stage. To my eyes, this is simply a pleasant display. My pleasure is vestigial, relict, when compared to the intensity with which it is examined by all those other eyes around me. For them, reading the code of color is survival.<br><br>Color reveals a layered natural text, most of it straightforward and necessary information. Some of it is the ink on a contract of partnership: the black sheen of chokecherry or currant <br>cf0signals to bears and birds that the fruit is ripe, and then chokecherry sprouts from bear shit and bird shit miles away. This is how chokecherry uses color to recruit bears and birds to spread its genes. Sometimes, there is deceit, as when a perfectly edible butterfly evolves into a dead ringer for a foul-tasting species. There is no premium on honesty or fair play where survival is concerned.<br><br>Every so often I test this observation with a cruel trick, leaving the bright-red plastic jug that holds gas for my chainsaw out on my front porch. On the right sort of day, calliope hummingbirds arrive within minutes to buzz and hover an inch or so away, believing they have encountered the world's biggest flower. I don't mean to lie to them. More, I am a child trying to form the first few letters of a fully formed and unimaginably complex alphabet of hummingbirds. Color makes me want to be able to read what is being said all around me. It is not a trivial desire, more an ache, a longing that grows out of what I suspect is a profound loss&#x2014;even more lost to many of my fellow humans who don't live as I do, with long days to think and wander a relatively undisturbed mountainside forest.<br><br>Every fall I try to plumb some of the depths of this longing with a sort of game some humans play. I hunt meat, an experience that is a pathetic substitute for what the hummingbird knows and sees every day, but one of the few ways I have of sustaining a life that is visibly coupled to the forces that created it. I don't kill for sport but for meat. Venison and elk provide most of the protein at my wife's and my table. Through the years, I have come to look forward to these fall weeks of hunting, less for the killing than for the seeing. Then I am able to perceive more detail&#x2014;literally. Hidden layers become visible. Every subtle shift of shape or sound in the forest may signal the advent of an important moment. Hunting enlivens the senses like no other experience, giving me a taste of what it must be like to truly see and hear.<br><br>Sometimes I hunt birds with dogs, and, again, the pleasure is not so much in killing the birds as in observing the dogs, equipped as they are with noses many times more powerful than mine. They raise their heads and face the wind, and their nostrils pulse and flare as if they are pumping in every bit of air to sample the surroundings. They smell the world in the same way that I see it.<br><br>I came to believe it was possible for me to know more of the world this way. One year I was hunting elk, and before seeing or hearing the beasts, I smelled them. I could smell the coming <br>fs20kill, and I was right. We know more than we think we do. Experiments have shown that normal people given the whiff of a T-shirt can tell whether it was worn by a man or woman, even have a sense of whether the wearer was attractive. How much of this have we sublimated? What would it be like to meet other humans and smell, say, anger, or arousal, as I am sure my dogs do?<br><br>Sensual experiences of this sort have spawned a certain curiosity in a few people, have sent perfectly civilized and privileged modern individuals to live among primitives in an attempt to comprehend in some blundering, bumbling manner just where the doors of our perception open. Richard Nelson, an anthropologist and a friend, made such a pilgrimage, spending his early adult years living among the Koyukon people of the Yukon River basin, an experience he recounts in fine books like <i>Make Prayers to the Raven</i>.<br><br>Nelson once told me a story. He had left the Yukon and settled on an island in the far different maritime environment of southeast Alaska, where he spent years hunting deer and closely observing the place, about which he eventually wrote <i>The Island Within</i>. He still maintained contact with his Koyukon friends, and after several years he invited a couple of them to come visit him&#x2014;a big deal for them, in that they had never been outside their familiar surroundings. Geographically unmoored as we postmoderns are, it is difficult for us to imagine what this means, but try to understand a human life in which all referents, all mental anchors and guides, are set in the natural features of a particular place.<br><br>Nelson, of course, was curious as to how they would respond, but not quite prepared for the way this reunion with old friends worked out. It was silent. As with all reunions among friends, there was catching up to do, greetings to be made, stories to tell&#x2014;but none of this happened, at least not right away. His friends simply lapsed into silence. They were so wrapped up in observing everything around them that there was no part of their brains left for speech. This went on for days. When finally they did speak, they revealed to Nelson all sorts of details about his closely observed island that he himself had never noticed.<br><br>There are beings, many of them human beings, that see, smell, hear, remember, sense more than we do. This is not a genetic accident, like being taller than six-foot-five or having an IQ of 150 or high cheekbones. This is a matter of culture. The human beings who maintain these 0hyper-refined senses are hunter-gatherers. Their impressive powers of perception have been noted and detailed by just about every student of hunter-gatherer groups. It is not only that they sense more than the rest of us do, but that they do so in a qualitatively different fashion. In his book <i>The Spell of the Sensuous</i>, David Abram leans on philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty's concept of synaesthesia to explain Abram's own experience with hunter-gatherer perceptions. The term "synaesthesia" describes something every child knows. In fact, Merleau-Ponty believes that we have "unlearned how to see, hear, and, generally speaking, to feel." Synaesthesia is the mental function (or suite of functions) in which the senses run together, in which colors have a feel to them and tastes have a color. We speak of a loud shirt, of bright music, yet how often do we sense reality this way? For Abram and other observers, the phenomenon marks a total immersion in sense, when the observer is no longer in control, no longer separating and analyzing sight, sound, and texture, and becomes a part of his sensual surroundings. That is, the observer calls forth the world.<br><br>"As soon as I attempt to distinguish the share of any one sense from that of the others, I inevitably sever the full participation of my sensing body with the sensuous terrain," writes Abram. "Many indigenous peoples construe awareness, or 'mind,' not as a power that resides inside their heads, but rather as a quality that they themselves <i>are inside of</i> along with the other animals and plants, the mountains and the clouds."<br><br>I mention all of this because my own hunting tells me it is true, and that is part of why the experience enlivens me. Yet I know it better still from the more common experience of making music. I became a musician as an adult. The advantage of that approach is that one has an adult's drive and discipline to pound away at practicing the necessary technical skills day after day. The disadvantage is that one needs the drive and discipline. Merleau-Ponty is right about "unlearning." As adults, we have unlearned how to hear. As a literate society, we trust notes on a printed page&#x2014;indeed, authorities of all sorts&#x2014;far more than we trust our own ears, such that a large part of my struggle to learn music has been to teach myself to hear. Immerse a child in music before this unlearning has occurred and real music, not just notes, flies from her fingers like the sung notes of a bird.<br><br>Yet lately, after years of learning the fundamentals and years of learning that the biggest <br>fs20barriers I face are those I unconsciously erect for myself, I have begun to believe what a music teacher once told me: "My main job is to teach you that you k...</p><h2>Selected Flute Solos (With Piano Accompaniment) (Everybody&#39;s Favorite)</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

Known as the Dust Bowl, this crisis has become a major referent of the climate change era, and has long served as a warning of the dire consequences of unchecked environmental despoliation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Through innovative research and a fresh theoretical lens, Hannah Holleman reexamines the global socioecological and economic forces of settler colonialism and imperialism precipitating this disaster, explaining critical antecedents to the acceleration of ecological degradation in our time. Holleman draws lessons from this period that point a way forward for environmental politics as we confront the growing global crises of climate change, freshwater scarcity, extreme energy, and soil degradation.</p><p><b>Hannah Holleman</b> is assistant professor of sociology at Amherst College, where she works in the areas of social theory, environmental sociology, environmental studies, political economy, and social movements.&#x201c;One does not often come across a book that is so radical on its surface and so reasonable in its deeper arguments.&#x201d;&#x2014;M.

Yet though the West has had unprecedented access to this hidden knowledge since the decipherment of hieroglyphs, ancient Egypt&#39;s connection with alchemy still remains obscure, doubted even by many. Focussing on the beautiful temples at Abu Simbel and Dendara, dedicated to the fiery serpent-eye goddess Hathor, this groundbreaking book explores for the first time the legacy left to alchemists by the pharaohs. It also goes deep into Ramesses VI&#39;s extraordinary tomb at Thebes to discover the secrets of growth and renewal guarded by Osiris and vivified by Hathor&#39;s copper love. Both metallurgical and mystical, these sacred secrets laid the foundations for the Hermetic art. The transmission initially came through Graeco-Egyptian and Jewish alchemists, then Islamic adepts, many of whom were Sufis belonging to an Akhmim alchemical lineage, until eventually Hathor&#39;s alchemy reached medieval Europe to inspire the &#39;rising dawn&#39; tradition. And with a spiritual vision grounded in nature, it still has vital relevance for our world today.</p><p>Dr. Alison M Roberts studied ancient Egyptian and Akkadian at Oxford University, where she received her doctorate in 1984.

It offers a detailed, uniquely comprehensive presentation of instruction on both the view and the practice. In the teachings contained in this book, Thrangu Rinpoche has distilled the essence of the Ninth Karmapa's massive text into manageable proportions and has given pointed guidance on the implementation of its instruction. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, Mahamudra practice is especially appropriate for Westerners and contemporary practitioners because it can be realized in the context of virtually any lifestyle. Mahamudra dissolves the artificial separation between phenomena and emptiness, revealing the radiant display of mind. The Ninth Karmapa's text has traditionally been available only to advanced students. However, Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche has kindly consented to the publication of these core teachings on the text, which he gave in the context of a retreat he led in 2001 in the mountains of British Columbia for 140 Western students. His compelling presentation provides teachers and students with a systematic approach to some of the highest practices in the Kagyu tradition. Thrangu Rinpoche's extraordinary wisdom and insight make this new commentary a peerless jewel in the canons of spiritual literature.</p><p>The most in-depth and famed text on Mahamudra ever written, The Ocean of Definitive Meaning by the 9th Karmapa offers a detailed, uniquely comprehensive presentation.

But when the bully next door wanted to meet secretly, Bond couldn't resist.

In The Gang&#x2019;s All Queer, Vanessa Panfil introduces us to a different world. Meet gay gang members &#x2013; sometimes referred to in popular culture as &#x201c;homo thugs&#x201d; &#x2013; whose gay identity complicates criminology&#x2019;s portrayal and representation of gangs, gang members, and gang life. In vivid detail, Panfil provides an in-depth understanding of how gay gang members construct and negotiate both masculine and gay identities through crime and gang membership. </p><p>The Gang&#x2019;s All Queer draws from interviews with over 50 gay gang- and crime-involved young men in Columbus, Ohio, the majority of whom are men of color in their late teens and early twenties, as well as on-the-ground ethnographic fieldwork with men who are in gay, hybrid, and straight gangs. Panfil provides an eye-opening portrait of how even members of straight gangs are connected to a same-sex oriented underground world. </p><p>Most of these young men still present a traditionally masculine persona and voice deeply-held affection for their fellow gang members. They also fight with their enemies, many of whom are in rival gay gangs. Most come from impoverished, &#x2018;rough&#x2019; neighborhoods, and seek to defy negative stereotypes of gay and Black men as deadbeats, though sometimes through illegal activity. Some are still closeted to their fellow gang members and families, yet others fight to defend members of the gay community, even those who they deem to be &#x201c;fags,&#x201d; despite distaste for these flamboyant members of the community. And some perform in drag shows or sell sex to survive. </p><p>The Gang&#x2019;s All Queer poignantly illustrates how these men both respond to and resist societal marginalization. Timely, powerful, and engaging, this book will challenge us to think differently about gangs, gay men, and urban life.</p></p><p><b>Vanessa R. Panfil</b> is Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice at Old Dominion University. She is the co-editor of the Handbook of LGBT Communities, Crime, and Justice."Panfilinserts herself into the underground of an underground . . . to better understand the experiences of gay men in the hypermasculine context of gang life. Complicates assumptions that male gang members and active offenders are exclusively heterosexual and . . . paves the way for a more in-depth understanding of a marginalized community." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"A gem of contemporary sociology: a potent reminder of the discipline's power to work past a culture's assumptions and, in the process, to articulate the reach and influence of those assumptions . . . its influence is likely to eventually spread far beyond the academy." (<i>Pacific Standard</i>)<br><br>"The Gangs All Queer offers a treasure trove of insights for gang scholars, but more importantly, demonstrates how much we all have to gain by embracing the queer criminological turn." (Jody Miller,author of Getting Played: African American Girls, Urban Inequality, and Gendered Violence)<br><br>"The Gang&#x2019;s All Queer offers a vivid and textured exploration of gay gang life that shatters popular and academic assumptions about the people who join gangs and the reasons that motivate their sustained participation in them ... Panfil effectively illuminates the tenuous tightrope that gay, bisexual, and queer gang members navigate to earn respect and protect their reputations in a culture defined almost exclusively by its toxic hypermasculinity ... The Gang&#x2019;s All Queer establishes a new agenda in the sociology of gangs that provokes a necessary reconsideration of how scholars and activists study gangs, queer identities, and black masculinities." (American Journal of Sociology)<br><br>"An interesting take on a world that never makes the headlines.Not only did Panfil have access to a group of men who were willing to tell all, she fully used that access to understand why a gay man would turn to a group thats stereotypically anti-gay. This leads to a bigger picture and larger questions of violence and closeting, as well as problems with being black, gay and gangster." (<i>Washington Blade</i>)<br><br>"Panfil&#x2019;s text shines a warm sharp light on the complex politics of masculinity and sexual identity among gang-involved men... Through a combination of methodological rigour, human engagement and stylistic verve, Panfil portrays a fluid repertoire of responses to the tension between masculinity and sexuality that exposes not only gang masculinity but the gang itself as a fragile construct." (British Journal of Criminology)<br><br>"Panfil...let[s] her informants give voice to their lives and concerns." (<i>The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review</i>)<br><br>"Panfil seeks to complicate the popular narratives surrounding gang members and the hypermasculine, hyper-heterosexual lives they lead. . .the book functions as an important tool in the recognition and the dismantling of systems that lead to the marginalization, poverty, and violence that [these]menface." (<i>Popmatters</i>)<br><br>"A fascinating and eye-opening portrait of young queer men involved in this countrys gang underworld, which is typically associated with hypermasculinity. . . .The book dives deep into the complexities of what it means to grow up queer in the hood and discusses how through gangs, disadvantaged youths can unite, feel empowered, and create their own families of support and protection even across lines of sexual identity." (<i>The Advocate</i>)<br><br>"Ariveting look at identity construction, the qualities of 'real'men, boundary maintenance (the things we do to present ourselves as wed truly like to be seen), and so many other nuanced components of the gay criminal lifestyle.If the highest praise is reserved for books that cause us to question deeply held beliefs, this book ranks among the best."

Shah Rukh Khan's larger than life tale takes us through the colorful and idiosyncratic Bollywood movie industry, where fantastic dreams and outrageous obsessions share the spotlight with extortion, murder, and corruption. Shah Rukh Khan broke into this $1.5 billion business despite the fact that it has always been controlled by a handful of legendary film families and sometimes funded by black market money. As a Muslim in a Hindu majority nation, exulting in classic Indian cultural values, Shah Rukh Khan has come to embody the aspirations and contradictions of a complicated culture tumbling headlong into American style capitalism. His story is the mirror to view the greater Indian story and the underbelly of the culture of Bollywood.<br>"A bounty for cinema lovers everywhere."<br> --Mira Nair, Director, <em>The Namesake</em> and <em>Monsoon Wedding</em><br><br> "King of Bollywood is the all-singing, all-dancing back stage pass to Bollywood. Anupama Chopra chronicles the political and cultural story of India with finesse and insight, through fly-on-wall access to one of its biggest, most charming and charismatic stars." <br> -- Gurinder Chadha, director of Bend it Like Beckham <br><br>"The "Easy Rider Raging Bull" of the Bollywood industry and essential reading for any Shah Rukh Khan fan."<br> --Emma Thompson, actress<br><br>"Anu Chopra infuses the pivotal moments of Shah Rukh Khan's life with an edge-of-your-seat tension worthy of the best Bollywood blockbusters."<br> --Kirkus<br></p><p>Anupama Chopra lives in Bombay, India.Although he's not a household name in America, Shah Rukh Khan, sometimes called the Tom Cruise of Hindi film, is a world-famous superstar, the kind who generates Elvis-level hysteria wherever he goes. Born in New Delhi in 1965, Shah Rukh grew up loving movies, with American John Travolta and Bill Cosby among the stars he admired. After graduating from high school, he moved from theater to television to movie acting, gradually finding his niche with brooding antihero roles, the sort that other actors rejected for fear of spoiling their leading-man image. As Shah Rukh has became a bigger star, playing a variety of roles, he also helped the industry expand. His films range from traditional themes (<i>Asoka</i>) to remakes of classics (<i>Devdas</i>), song-and-dance romances and even <i>Mission Impossible</i>&#x2013;type films like <i>Don</i>. Chopra, a Mumbai-based freelance journalist who comes from a filmmaking family herself, offers readers both the life story of Shah Rukh and a condensed history of the Indian film industry. Even if you know nothing about Indian cinema, her prose style (Bollywood now recoiled from the mafia like a man shrinking from a sore-covered leper on the street) makes this a bizarrely fun read. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p><h2>For Love of Animals: Christian Ethics, Consistent Action</h2><p><i>For Love of Animals</i> is an honest and thoughtful look at our responsibility as Christians with respect to animals. Many Christians misunderstand both history and their own tradition in thinking about animals. They are joined by prominent secular thinkers who blame Christianity for the Western world's failure to seriously consider the moral status of animals.<br><br>This book explains how traditional Christian ideas and principles&#x2014;like nonviolence, concern for the vulnerable, respect for life, stewardship of God's creation, and rejection of consumerism&#x2014;require us to treat animals morally. Though this point of view is often thought of as liberal, the book cites several conservatives who are also concerned about animals. Camosy's Christian argument transcends secular politics.<br><br>The book's starting point for a Christian position on animals&#x2014;from the creation story in Genesis to Jesus' eating habits in the Gospels&#x2014;rests in Scripture. It then moves to explore the views of the Church Fathers, the teachings of the Catholic Church, and current discussions in both Catholic and Protestant theology. Ultimately, however, the book is concerned not with abstract ideas, but with how we should live our everyday lives. Should Christians eat meat? Is cooperation with factory farming evil? What sort of medical research on animals is justified? Camosy also asks difficult questions about hunting and pet ownership.<br><br>This is an ideal resource for those who are interested in thinking about animals from the perspective of Christian ethics and the consistent ethic of life. Discussion questions at the end of each chapter and suggestions for further reading round out the usefulness of this important work.</p><p>Charles Camosy is an assistant professor of Christian Ethics at Fordham University. He holds a B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame, and has a particular interest in the fields of bioethics, healthcare and clinical ethics, moral anthropology, and Catholic social teaching, among other areas. His early work focused on medical and clinical ethics with regard to stem cell research and the treatment of critically ill newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit, which was the focus of his first book, <i>Too Expensive to Treat? Finitude, Tragedy, and the Neonatal ICU</i>, awarded second place in the Social Issues category by the Catholic Press Association. His second book, <i>Peter Singer and Christian Ethics: Beyond Polarization</i>, uses intellectual solidarity in an attempt to begin a sustained and fruitful conversation between Peter Singer and Christian ethics. Camosy also convenes the bioethics section for the Catholic Theological Society of America and the ethics section for the College Theology Society.Should Christians eat meat, hunt, or have pets? Does a consistent pro-life conviction require recognizing the moral life of non-human animals? Catholic bioethicist Camosy (<i>Peter Singer and Christian Ethics</i>) convincingly argues that the Bible, Christian tradition, and Catholic social doctrine all require these questions to be addressed seriously and thoroughly. Camosy is fully aware that his thesis is a hard sell. Discussion questions and suggestions for further reading make this an excellent primer for a group discussion that begins in Genesis and concludes with Michael Vick's dogfighting conviction. Some readers may stumble over Camosy's accusation of "speciesism" or his foray into treatises on angels and extraterrestrials to explain why humans are not the only rational beings capable of moral reasoning, but those who persevere will be rewarded with fine definitions of justice; complex, applicable explanations of "cooperation with evil" (especially in the context of factory farming); and a serious, well-argued challenge to baser market forces that make an idol of utilitarianism. Justice for animals must be part of a consistent ethic of life, Camosy concludes, giving readers grave second thoughts about the next order of McNuggets. &#x2014;<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><br><br>Charles Camosy, a professor of Christian ethics at Fordham University, has written a provocative little book entitled <i>For Love of Animals</i> that challenges Catholics to consider not only what we eat but also how we relate to animals in light of Christian tradition. His concern is that we have become ethical slouches....Drawing on Scripture, the Church&#x2019;s teaching regarding creation, and recent papal statements&#x2014;especially Pope Benedict XVI&#x2019;s <i>Caritas in Veritate</i>&#x2014;Camosy concludes that a consistent Christian principle of justice leads to vegetarianism, cessation of factory farming, hunting and using animals for research, as well as reconsidering how we relate to pets.<br><br>....[T]his book achieves something important: it offers Catholics a chance to reflect on what we eat, how we relate to God&#x2019;s creation and ultimately who we are. &#x2014;Scott Kline, <i>The Christian Herald</i>, Toronto <br><br>Every once in a while, a book comes along that does something few books ever do, which is to change something fundamental about the way you live your life. For some people reading these words, theologian Charles Camosy&#x2019;s <i>For Love of Animals</i> will be that book.<br><br>And for good reason: its subject&#x2014;the rights and wrongs of our modern treatment of animals, especially (though not only) mammals, and especially (though not only) the creatures of factory farms&#x2014;is simultaneously morally urgent and widely ignored by many people, including and inexplicably by many well-meaning but hitherto under-informed Christians. <br><br>Dr. Camosy has now remedied that defect with this lively, thoughtful, and original book. It ranges widely but with a teacherly touch over subjects as diverse as the history of Christian vegetarianism; papal and other pronouncements about creation; the development of Christian theology concerning nonhuman persons, such as angels; the morality of dogfighting; the relevance of laws against child labor; the question of pets; the truth about factory farming; and much more. Throughout, the author convinces the reader both that our culture&#x2019;s treatment of defenseless creatures is morally indefensible much of the time; and also that &#x201c;those of us who follow Jesus Christ,&#x201d; in particular, &#x201c;should give animals special moral consideration and attention.&#x201d;<br><br>It is rampant and unexamined Western consumerism, more than anything else, that &#x201c;disconnects[s] us from the process by which pig meat gets on our plate.&#x201d; I would add to that analysis the friendly amendment that this same consumerism encourages the formation of a habit that is suspect wherever and whenever it appears, but that chronically gets a pass where animals are involved: that is, a practiced desire to remain ignorant of those things about which we wish not to know.It would be gratifying if the book were also to start a serious discussion in Christian religious quarters. One wonders, for example, whether vegetarianism for some believers might be a unique &#x201c;sign of contradiction&#x201d; in its own right&#x2014;particularly in a time of relative plenty marked by rampant consumerism, and particularly given what Pope John Paul II decried as an accompanying &#x201c;culture of death.&#x201d; Wanton cruelty to animals, of the sort that is now pitiably routine, is arguably part and parcel of that same culture, and it further deadens the general moral sense at a time when it&#x2019;s arguably needed most. As a vegetarian named Leo Tolstoy once put it, in a powerful 1909 essay that he wrote about a slaughterhouse: &#x201c;[W]e cannot pretend that we do not know this. We are not ostriches, and cannot believe that if we refuse to look at what we do not wish to see, it will not exist.&#x201d;<br><br>The community of people now struggling to understand as much, and to do right by creatures both great and small, is in the process of constructing a wholly new big tent. Thanks to Camosy&#x2019;s welcome contribution, it just got noticeably bigger. &#x2014;from the Foreword, Mary Eberstadt, Senior fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington, DC, August 2013</p><h2>Ordinary Superpowers: Unleash the Full Potential of Your Most Natural Talents</h2><p>Positive change.

Previously an associate pastor at Life Christian Church in St. Louis, Missouri, she developed, coordinated, and taught a weekly meeting known as "Life In The Word."

Speer was one of the few defendants at the Nuremberg Trials to take responsibility for Nazi war crimes, even as he denied knowledge of the Holocaust. Now this enigma of a man is unveiled in a monumental biography by a writer who came to know Speer intimately in his final years. Out of hundreds of hours of interviews, Sereny unravels the threads of Speer's personality: the genius that made him indispensable to the German war machine, the conscience that drove him to repent, and the emotional wounds that made him susceptible to Hitler's lethal magnetism. Read as an inside account of the Third Reich, or as a revelatory unsparing yet compassionate study of the human capacity for evil, <b>Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth</b> is a triumph.<br>"Fascinating...Not only a major addition to our knowledge of the Third Reich, but a stunning attempt to understand the nature of good and evil."--Newsday<br>"More than a biography...It also constitutes a perceptive re-examination of the mysterious appeal of Adolf Hitler."--San Francisco Chronicle</p><p>Gitta Sereny's biography meticulously re-creates for the reader the professional, emotional, and psychological life of Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and later his Minister of Armaments. Throughout the 12-year history of the Third Reich, Speer remained one of Hitler's most trusted confidants and one of the most powerful political leaders of the Nazi party. Researched and written over an eight year period, <i>Albert Speer</i> weaves together information from innumerable personal interviews with Speer, his family, close friends, and professional colleagues, the author's own solid grasp of German history, and critical readings of Speer's own writings, including various drafts of his memoirs, <i>Inside the Third Reich</i>, first published in 1969. <p> Throughout, Sereny consciously avoids the pitfall of many Speer biographers, who seek to either blame or exculpate Speer for the Nazi's atrocities. Instead, she succeeds in helping the reader understand a "morally extinguished" man and place into context "all the crimes against humanity which Hitler initiated, which continue to threaten us today, and of which Speer, who was in many ways a man of excellence, sadly enough made himself a part." Well over 700 pages, <i>Albert Speer</i> is not a quick read, but superbly written and meticulously researched, it is a pleasure to read, providing unprecedented insight into one of the most complex figures in modern German history. <i>--Bertina Loeffler</i></p><b>Gitta Sereny</b>&nbsp;was one of Europe's foremost journalists with a special interest and expertise in the Third Reich.

She has curlers in her hair, a fag dangling from the corner of her mouth. Her shoes are worn down, barely covering the swollen, aching feet. Her gaze is empty. On the bare skin of her upper arms you can just make out a violet mark, bruising. Perhaps her husband beats her.</p><p>But the trolley is full. Filled to bursting.</p><p>Cans, cartons, bags. Food. Microwave meals. Her body is a lump of flesh forced inside her skin, which in turn has been crammed into the tight skirt, the tight top. The gaze is empty, the lips hard around the cigarette, a glimpse of teeth. The hands grip the trolley handle.</p><p>And the trolley is full. Filled to bursting.</p><p>David drew in air through his nostrils, could almost smell the mixture of cheap perfume and supermarket sweat.</p><p>Death...</p><p>Every time his ideas dried up, when he felt hesitant, he looked at this picture.

I&#x2019;ll come in a minute.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Ab...so...lut filth. What does that mean?&#x2019;</p><p>David closed the newspaper and took hold of Magnus&#x2019; shoulders. Magnus struggled, trying to open the paper.</p><p>&#x2018;Magnus! I&#x2019;m serious. If you don&#x2019;t let me work now I won&#x2019;t have any time for you later.

The window to the Kungsholmen shoreline was wide open but there was almost no breeze, and David was sweating even though his upper body was bare.</p><p>He opened the newspaper again. Something funny had to come of this.</p><p>Absolut filth!</p><p>A giveaway promotion featuring adult magazines and liquor; two women from the Swedish Centre Party pouring vodka over an issue of Hustler as a protest. Distressed, read the caption. David studied their faces. Mostly, they looked belligerent, as if they wanted to pulverise the photographer with their eyes. The spirits ran down over the naked woman on the cover.</p><p>It was so grotesque it was hard to make something funny out of it. David&#x2019;s gaze scoured the image, tried to find a point of entry.</p><p>Photograph: Putte Merkert</p><p>There it was.</p><p>The photographer. David leaned back in the chair, looked up at the ceiling and started to formulate something. After several minutes he had the bare outline of a script written in longhand. He looked at the women again. Now their accusing gazes were directed at him.</p><p>&#x2018;So; planning to make fun of us and our beliefs are you?&#x2019; they said. &#x2018;What about you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes, OK,&#x2019; David said out loud to the newspaper. &#x2018;But at least I know I&#x2019;m a clown, unlike the two of you.&#x2019;</p><p>He kept writing, with a buzzing headache that he put down to a nagging conscience. After twenty minutes he had a passable routine that might even be amusing if he milked it for all it was worth. He glanced up at Supermarket Lady but received no guidance. Possibly he was walking in her footsteps, sitting in her basket.</p><p>It was half past four. Four and a half hours until he was due on stage, and there were already butterflies in his stomach.</p><p>He made a cup of coffee, smoked a cigarette and went in to see Magnus, spent half an hour talking about Pok�mon, helped Magnus to sort the cards and interpret what they said.</p><p>&#x2018;Dad,&#x2019; Magnus asked, &#x2018;what exactly is your job?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You already know that. You were there at Norra Brunn once. I tell stories and people laugh and...Then I get paid for it.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Why do they laugh?&#x2019;</p><p>David looked into Magnus&#x2019; serious eight-year-old&#x2019;s eyes and burst into laughter himself. He stroked Magnus&#x2019; head and answered, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know. I really don&#x2019;t know. Now I&#x2019;m going to have some coffee.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, you&#x2019;re always drinking coffee.&#x2019;</p><p>David got up from the floor where the cards lay spread out. When he reached the door, he turned around to look at his son, whose lips moved as he read one of his cards.</p><p>&#x2018;I think,&#x2019; David said, &#x2018;that people laugh because they want to laugh. They have paid to come and laugh, and so they laugh.&#x2019;</p><p>Magnus shook his head. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t get it.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; David said, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t either.&#x2019;</p><p>Eva came back from work at half past five and David greeted her in the hall.</p><p>&#x2018;Hi sweetheart,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;What&#x2019;s up?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Death, death, death,&#x2019; David replied, holding his hands over his stomach. He kissed her. Her upper lip was salt with sweat. &#x2018;And you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Fine. A little bit of a headache. Otherwise I&#x2019;m fine. Have you been able to write?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, it...&#x2019; David gestured vaguely at the desk. &#x2018;Yes, but it isn&#x2019;t that good.&#x2019;</p><p>Eva nodded. &#x2018;No, I know. Will I get to hear it later?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;If you like.&#x2019;</p><p>Eva left to find Magnus, and David went to the bathroom, let some of the nervousness drain out of him. He remained on the toilet seat for a while, studying the pattern of white fishes on the shower curtain. He wanted to read his script to Eva; in fact, he needed to read it to her. It was funny, but he was ashamed of it and was afraid that Eva would say something about...the ideas behind it. Of which there were none. He flushed, then rinsed his face with cold water.</p><p>I&#x2019;m an entertainer. Plain and simple.</p><p>Yes. Of course. He made a light dinner&#x2014;a mushroom omelette&#x2014;while Magnus and Eva laid out the Monopoly board in the living room. David&#x2019;s underarms ran with sweat as he stood at the stove saut�ing the mushrooms.</p><p>This weather. It isn&#x2019;t natural.</p><p>An image suddenly loomed in his mind: the greenhouse effect. Yes. The Earth as a gigantic greenhouse. With us planted here millions of years ago by aliens. Soon they&#x2019;ll be back for the harvest.</p><p>He scooped the omelette onto plates and called out that dinner was served. Good image, but was it funny? No. But if you added someone fairly well known, like...a newspaper columnist, say&#x2014;Staffan Heimersson&#x2014;and said he was the leader of the aliens in disguise. So therefore Staffan Heimersson&#x2019;s solely responsible for the greenhouse effect...</p><p>&#x2018;What are you thinking about?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, nothing. That it&#x2019;s Staffan Heimersson&#x2019;s fault it&#x2019;s so warm.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;OK...&#x2019;</p><p>Eva waited. David shrugged. &#x2018;No, that was it. Basically.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Mum?&#x2019; Magnus was done picking the tomato slices out of his salad. &#x2018;Robin said that if the Earth gets warmer the dinosaurs will come back, is that true?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His headache got worse during the game of Monopoly, and everyone became unnecessarily grumpy when they lost money. After half an hour they took a break for Bolibompa, the children&#x2019;s program, and Eva went to the kitchen and made some espresso. David sat in the sofa and yawned. As always when he was nervous he became drowsy, just wanted to sleep.</p><p>Magnus curled up next to him and they watched a documentary about the circus. When the coffee was ready, David got up despite Magnus&#x2019; protests. Eva was at the stove, fiddling with one of the knobs.</p><p>&#x2018;Strange,&#x2019; she remarked, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t turn it off.&#x2019;</p><p>The power light wouldn&#x2019;t go off. David turned some knobs at random, but nothing happened. The burner on which the coffee pot sat gurgling was red-hot. They couldn&#x2019;t be bothered doing anything to it for the moment, so David read his piece out while they drank the heavily sugared espresso and smoked. Eva thought it was funny.</p><p>&#x2018;Can I do it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Absolutely.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t think that it&#x2019;s...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Well, going too far. They&#x2019;re right, of course.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Well? What does that have to do with it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, of course. Thanks.&#x2019;</p><p>Ten years they had been married, and hardly a day went by that David did not look at Eva and think, &#x2018;How bloody lucky I am.&#x2019; Naturally there were black days. Weeks, even, without joy or the possibility of it, but even then, at the bottom of all the murk, he knew there was a placard that read bloody good luck. Maybe he couldn&#x2019;t see it at that moment, but it always resurfaced.</p><p>She worked as an editor and il...</p></p><h2>Batman: Detective Comics Vol. 1: Mythology</h2><p><b>The Arkham Knight has arrived in Gotham City with an entire round table of deadly allies, and their first encounter will leave Batman shaken to his core!</b><br><br>Alfred Pennyworth...attacked at Wayne mansion!

Unfortunately, however, many modern practitioners have lost sight of the origins of their discipline. <em>A Cabinet of Ancient Medical Curiosities </em>aspires to cure this lapse by taking readers back to the early days of Western medicine in ancient Greece and Rome. Quoting the actual words of ancient authors, often from texts which have never before been translated into English, J. C. McKeown offers a fascinating glimpse at the origins of surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, pharmacology, diet and nutrition, and many other fields of medicine. <br><br>This book features hundreds of passages from Greek and Roman authors, with gentle guidance from McKeown, giving a vividly direct picture of the ancient medical world, a world in which, for example, a surgeon had to be strong-minded enough to ignore the screams of his patient, diseases were assumed to be sent by the gods, medicine and magic were often indistinguishable, and no qualifications were required before setting oneself up as a doctor. On the other hand, McKeown reveals that some ancient medical attitudes were also surprisingly similar to our own. Beyond the practice of medicine, McKeown highlights ancient views on familiar topics, such as medical ethics and the role of the doctor in society. A fascinating exploration of the bizarre - and sometimes grotesque - medical beliefs of the past, <em>A Cabinet of Ancient Medical Curiosities</em> will delight anyone with an interest in the history of medicine or the ancient world.<br></p><p><br><strong>J.C. McKeown</strong> is Professor of Classics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, coeditor of the <em>Oxford Anthology of Roman Literature</em>, and author of <em>Classical Latin: An Introductory Course, A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities</em>, and <em>A Cabinet of Greek Curiosities.</em><br><br>"McKeown has translated a wide variety of ancient sources on medicine and compiled them in an accessible and affordable book, which could benefit a student of ancient medicine who is not fluent in Greek or Latin. The only comparable collection of ancient medical sources in translation is James Longrigg's more limited and significantly more sober <em>Greek Medicine from the Heroic to the Hellenistic Age: A Source Book</em> (1998), and it seems there is room for more such anthologies with the proliferation of university courses on the history of medicine. If used with care (by avoiding the preface and random comments), McKeown's book presents a stimulating snapshot of the many visual and written sources available to the historian of medicine." --Winston Black, <em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"As well organized as it is erudite, the compendium tilts toward classics enthusiasts, but there's still plenty of material to amaze an audience outside the ivory tower." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Religions in Practice: An Approach to the Anthropology of Religion (100 Cases)</h2><p><p><em>Religions in Practice</em> provides a comprehensive and primarily theme-based overview for students of the anthropology of religion. Whilst covering traditional topics such as magic, witchcraft, and spiritual healing, the book addresses key contemporary subjects including migration, transnationalism, nationalism, secularism, and law. It offers an issues-oriented perspective on everyday religious behaviors and examines small-scale societies as well as major, established religions. Throughout the text Bowen engages with ongoing debates concerning the place of religion in public life. He successfully balances the presentation of theory and concepts with rich case study examples, integrating theoretical discussion with a wide range of cross-cultural ethnographic material. </p> <p></p> <p>This seventh edition has been updated throughout. The opening section now focuses more clearly on the question of what is &#x2018;religion&#x2019; and on approaches to studying religion.

People all over the world &#x2013; from Amazonian villages to Iranian prisons &#x2013; need human rights to gain recognition, campaign for justice, and save lives. But how can we secure a brighter future for human rights? What changes are required to confront the regime&#x2019;s weaknesses and emerging global challenges?<br><br> In this cutting-edge analysis, Alison Brysk sets out a pragmatic reformist agenda for human rights in the twenty-first century. Tracing problems and solutions through contemporary case studies &#x2013; the plight of refugees, declining democracies such as Mexico and Turkey, the expansion of women&#x2019;s rights, new norms for indigenous peoples, and rights regression in the USA &#x2013; she shows that the dynamic strength of human rights lies in their evolving political practice. This distinctive vision demands that we build upon the gains of the human rights regime to construct new pathways which address historic rights gaps, from citizenship to security, from environmental protection to resurgent nationalism, and to globalization itself. <br><br>Drawing on the author&#x2019;s extensive experience as a leading human rights scholar and activist, <i>The Future of</i> <i>Human Rights</i> offers a broad and authoritative guide to the big questions in global human rights governance today.</p><p><b>Alison Brysk</b> is the Duncan and Suzanne Mellichamp Professor in Global Studies and Political Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.&#x201c;An excellent analysis of the full range of issues and tensions that characterize current human rights practice and governance today.&#x201d;<br><b>Sam Gregory, Harvard Kennedy School and Program Director, WITNESS<br><br></b>&#x201c;Alison Brysk makes a compelling, pragmatic, and, ultimately, optimistic argument for the incredible resilience of human rights.

Additional topics include circles and regular polygons, projective geometry, symmetries, inversions, knots and links, graphs, surfaces, and informal topology. This republication of a popular text is substantially less expensive than prior editions and offers a new Preface by the author.</p><p>The main purpose of this book is to inform the reader about the formal, or axiomatic, development of Euclidean geometry. It follows Euclid&#39;s classic text Elements very closely, with an excellent organization of the subject matter, and over 1,000 practice exercises provide the reader with hands-on experience in solving geometrical problems. Providing a historical perspective about the study of plane geometry, this book covers such topics as other geometries, the neutral geometry of the triangle, non-neutral Euclidean geometry, circles and regular polygons, projective geometry, symmetries, inversions, informal topology, graphs, surfaces, and knots and links.<p><b>Organization</b></p> <p> The main purpose of this book is to provide prospective high school mathematics teachers with the geometric background they need. Its core, consisting of Chapters 2 to 5, is therefore devoted to a fairly formal (that is, axiomatic) development of Euclidean geometry. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 complement this with an exposition of transformation geometry. The first chapter, which introduces teachers-to-be to non-Euclidean geometries, provides them with a perspective meant to enhance their appreciation of axiomatic systems. The much more informal Chapters 9 through 12 are meant to give students a taste of some more recent geometric discoveries. </p> <p> The development of synthetic Euclidean geometry begins by following Euclid's <i>Elements</i> very closely. This has the advantage of convincing students that they are learning "the real thing." It also happens to be an excellent organization of the subject matter. Witness the well-known fact that the first 28 propositions are all neutral. These subtleties might be lost on the typical high school student, but familiarity with Euclid's classic text must surely add to the teacher's confidence and effectiveness in the classroom. I am also in complete agreement with the sentiments Todhunter displayed in the previous excerpt: No other system of teaching geometry is better than Euclid's, provided, of course that his list of propositions is supplemented with a sufficient number of exercises. Occasionally, though, because some things have changed over two millennia, or else because of errors in the <i>Elements,</i> it was found advantageous either to expound both the modern and ancient versions in parallel or else to part ways with Euclid. </p> <p> In order to convince prospective teachers of the need to prove "obvious" propositions, the axiomatic development of Euclidean geometry is preceded by the informal description of both spherical and hyperbolic geometry. The trigonometric formulas of these geometries are included in order to lend numerical substance to these alternate and unfamiliar systems. The part of the course dedicated to synthetic geometry covers the standard material about triangles, parallelism, circles, ratios, and similarity; it concludes with the classic theorems that lead to projective geometry. These lead naturally to a discussion of ideal points and lines in the extended plane. Experience indicates that the nonoptional portions of the first five chapters can be completed in about three quarters of a one semester course. During that time the typical weekly homework assignment called for about a dozen proofs. </p> <p> Chapters 6 and 7 are concerned mostly with transformation geometry and symmetry. The planar rigid motions are completely and rigorously classified. This is followed by an informal discussion of frieze patterns and wallpaper designs. Inversions are developed formally and their utility for both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry is explained. </p> <p> The exposition in Chapters 8 through 12 is informal in the sense that few proofs are either offered or required. Their purpose is to acquaint students with some of the geometry that was developed in the last two centuries. Care has been taken to supply a great number of calculational exercises that will provide students with hands-on experience in these advanced topics. </p><p> </p><p> The purpose of Chapter 8 is threefold. First there is an exposition of some interesting facts, such as Euler's equation and the Platonic and Archimedian solids. This is followed by a representation of the rotational symmetries of the regular solids by means of permutations, a discussion of their symmetry groups, and a visual definition of isomorphism. Both of these discussions aim to develop the prospective teacher's ability to visualize three dimensional phenomena. Finally comes the tale of Monstrous Moonshine. </p> <p> Chapter 9 consists of a short introduction to the notions of homeomorphism and isotopy. Chapter 10 acquaints students with some standard topics of graph theory: traversability, colorability, and planarity. The topology of surfaces, both of the closed and the bordered varieties, is the subject of Chapter 11. Algorithms are described for identification of the topological type of any bordered surface. Two knot theoretic invariants are described in Chapter 12, including the recently discovered Jones polynomial. </p> <p><b>Exercises</b></p> <p> In Chapters 2 to 5 exercises are listed following every two or three propositions. This helps the professor select appropriate homework assignments and eliminates some of the guesswork for students. The great majority of these exercises call for straightforward applications of the immediately preceding propositions. On the other hand, the chapter review exercises provide problems for which the determination of the applicable propositions does require thought. In the remaining and less formal chapters the exercises appear at the end of each section. Each chapter concludes with a list of review problems. Solutions and/or hints to selected exercises are provided at the end of the book. </p> <p> The exercises that are interspersed with the propositions are of four types. There are relational and constructive propositions in whose answers the students should adhere to the same format that is used in the numbered propositions. The third type of exercises has to do with the alternate spherical, hyperbolic, and taxicab geometries; in these the appropriate response usually consists of one or two English sentences. The fourth, and last, type of exercises calls for the use of some computer program, and these are marked with a (C). </p> <p> In the other chapters, namely Chapter 1 and Chapters 6 through 12, exercises are listed at the end of each section. The emphasis in these is on the algorithmic aspect of geometry. They mostly require the straightforward, albeit nontrivial, application of the methods expounded in the text. </p> <p><b>Notation and Conventions</b></p> <p> Chapters 2 to 5 of this text present most of the content of Book I and selected topics from Books, II, III, IV, and VI of <i>The Elements.</i> In addition to the conventional labeling of propositions by <i>chapter, section,</i> and <i>number</i> these propositions are also identified by a parenthesized roman numeral, number that pinpoints their appearance in Euclid's book. For example, the Theorem of Pythagoras is listed as Proposition 3.3.2(L47). Exercises are identified in a similar manner,: Exercise 5.313.6 is the sixth exercise in group B of the third section in Chapter 5. The symbol (C) is used to distinguish exercises that call for the use of computer applications. </p></p><h2>Elements of Mathematics: From Euclid to G�del</h2><p><p><b>An exciting look at the world of elementary mathematics</b></p><p><i>Elements of Mathematics</i> takes readers on a fascinating tour that begins in elementary mathematics&#x2015;but, as John Stillwell shows, this subject is not as elementary or straightforward as one might think. Not all topics that are part of today's elementary mathematics were always considered as such, and great mathematical advances and discoveries had to occur in order for certain subjects to become "elementary." Stillwell examines elementary mathematics from a distinctive twenty-first-century viewpoint and describes not only the beauty and scope of the discipline, but also its limits.</p><p>From Gaussian integers to propositional logic, Stillwell delves into arithmetic, computation, algebra, geometry, calculus, combinatorics, probability, and logic. He discusses how each area ties into more advanced topics to build mathematics as a whole. Through a rich collection of basic principles, vivid examples, and interesting problems, Stillwell demonstrates that elementary mathematics becomes advanced with the intervention of infinity. Infinity has been observed throughout mathematical history, but the recent development of "reverse mathematics" confirms that infinity is essential for proving well-known theorems, and helps to determine the nature, contours, and borders of elementary mathematics.</p><p><i>Elements of Mathematics</i> gives readers, from high school students to professional mathematicians, the highlights of elementary mathematics and glimpses of the parts of math beyond its boundaries.</p></p><p><p>"The coherence of mathematics is on display in this masterful, beautifully written synthesis. With probing questions, lucid explanations, and fascinating examples and stories, John Stillwell reveals where the seemingly separate branches of math came from, how they intertwine, and why the hidden unifier is the deepest idea of all: infinity."<b>--Steven Strogatz, Cornell University and author of <i>The Joy of x</i></b></p><p>"This is a beautifully written overview and excursion through elementary mathematics, written to appeal to nonspecialists.

This information is independent of the supply voltages or the circuitry that is used to generate it. With analog, the output information is basic electrical values--volts, current, charge--and is always related to some real world parameters. With analog, the methodology used to arrive at the answers is intrinsic to the quality of those answers. Errors such as temperature, noise, delay and time stability can all affect the analog output and all are a function of the circuitry that generates the output. It is this analog output that is difficult to derive and requires experience and circuit design talent. With integrated circuits (ICs) so prevalent, combined with application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in most systems, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find good analog examples for teaching engineers analog design. Engineering schools provide the basics of device terminal characteristics and some circuit hookup information, but this is not adequate for designing finished circuits or applying modern IC design techniques. The analog circuitry in today&#x2019;s systems is often difficult to decipher without help from the original designer. The ability to design complex analog systems relies on the ability of engineers to learn from what has gone before. One of the best avenues for learning analog design is to use the application notes and information from companies who supply analog integrated circuits. These application notes include circuitry, test results, and the basic reasoning for some of the choices made in the design of these analog circuits. They provide a good starting point for new designs. Since the applications are aimed at solving problems, the application notes, combined with the capability to simulate circuits on Spice, provide a key learning pathway for engineers. The analog information in most of these application notes is timeless and will be as valid twenty years from now as it is today. It&#x2019;s my hope that anyone reading this book is helped through the science and art of good analog design. <p>Read an excerpt from <i>Analog Circuit Design</i>.</p> <p></p>Robert Dobkin <br>Co-Founder, Vice President, Engineering, and Chief Technical Officer <br>Linear Technology Corporation <p></p><strong>Images from Inside Jim Williams's Lab</strong> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </td><td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>Bob Dobkin is a founder and Chief Technical Officer of Linear Technology Corporation.

Since the last comprehensive etymological dictionary of Latin appeared in 1959, enormous progress has been made in the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, and many etymologies have been revised. This new etymological dictionary covers the entire Latin lexicon of Indo-European origin. It consists of nearly 1900 entries, which altogether discuss about 8000 Latin lemmata. All words attested before Cicero are included, together with their first date of attestation in Latin. The dictionary also includes all the inherited words found in the other ancient Italic languages, such as Oscan, Umbrian and South Picene; thus, it also serves as an etymological dictionary of Italic.<b>Michiel de Vaan</b> (Ph.D. 2002) teaches comparative Indo-European linguistics, historical linguistics and dialectology at Leiden University.

Providing a thinking curriculum is especially important for those children in diverse classrooms who have been underserved by our educational system.</i><br>&#x2014; Becoming Scientists</p><p>Good science starts with a question, perhaps from the teacher at the start of a science unit or from the children as they wonder what makes a toy car move, how food decomposes, or why leaves change color. Using inquiry science, children discover answers to their questions in the same way that scientists do&#x2014;they design experiments, make predictions, observe and describe, offer and test explanations, and share their conjectures with others. In essence, they construct their own understanding of how the world works through experimentation, reflection, and discussion.</p><p>Look into real classrooms where teachers practice inquiry science and engage students in the science and engineering practices outlined in the Next Generation Science Standards. Rusty Bresser and Sharon Fargason show teachers how to do the following:</p><ul> <li>Build on students' varied experiences, background knowledge, and readiness</li> <li>Respond to the needs of students with varying levels of English language proficiency</li> <li>Manage a diverse classroom during inquiry science exploration</li> <li>Facilitate science discussions</li> <li>Deepen their own science content knowledge</li></ul><p>As the authors state, "Inquiry science has little to do with textbooks and lectures and everything to do with our inherent need as a species to learn about and reflect on the world around us."

Dennis Shirley presents <i>five new imperatives</i> to guide educators and policymakers towards a re-thinking of what it means to teach effectively and to learn in depth. The <i>evidentiary imperative</i> requires educators to attain a better grasp of what data actually reveal about international trends in student learning. The <i>interpretive</i> <i>imperative </i>encourages mindful deliberation before acting on evidence in order to promote the integrity of a school community. The <i>professional imperative</i> describes new international research findings on promising pedagogies and curricula that propel learning in new directions. The <i>global imperative </i>argues that we all must look beyond our national boundaries to improve the flourishing of all young people, wherever they may be found. Finally, the <i>existential imperative</i> reminds us that students look to their teachers as role models who can dignify learning with meaning and embellish life with joy. Visionary in its scope and practical in its details, <i>The New Imperatives of Educational Change</i> is an indispensable road map for all teachers, principals, and system leaders. </p></p><p><p>Dennis Shirley is Professor of Education at the Lynch School of Education at Boston College and Editor-in-Chief of the <i>&nbsp;Journal of Educational Change</i>.</p><p>"Every now and then that rare book is published that provides a dramatic new argument for a better future for our schools and society. <em>The New Imperatives of Educational Change</em> is such a game changer.

Ducommun Professor Emeritus, Stanford University, US</p> <p>"In this deeply humane book, doing what is right for students as whole and happy individuals, developing their gifts, skills and talents, comes first. But the picture is completed by finally acknowledging that in public education, the individual is not the only beneficiary. Creative, compassionate, critical thinkers are essential to a just and democratic society where all can live and thrive together. It&#x2019;s more than a contribution to our economy.

The successful management of information has become so critical to a company&#39;s goals, that in many ways, now is the age of the CIO. Yet IT executives are besieged by a host of contradictions: bad technology can bring a company to its knees, but corporate boards rarely employ CIOs; CIOs must keep costs down at the very same time that they drive innovation. CIOs are focused on the future, while they are tethered by technology decisions made in the past. These contradictions form what Martha Heller calls The CIO Paradox, a set of conflicting forces that are deeply embedded in governance, staffing, executive expectations, and even corporate culture. Heller, who has spent more than 12 years working with the CIO community, offers guidance to CIOs on how to attack, reverse, or neutralize the paradoxical elements of the CIO role. Through interviews with a wide array of successful CIOs, The CIO Paradox helps readers level the playing field for IT success and get one step closer to bringing maximum value to their companies.</p><p><b>Martha Heller</b> is one of the most widely followed voices on IT leadership and the role of the CIO. She has been a <i>CIO</i> magazine columnist since 1999, and is also the author of <i>Be the Business: CIOs in the New Era of IT</i> (Bibliomotion, 2016).<br><br>Martha is president of Heller Search Associates, an executive recruiting firm that specializes in IT leadership positions nationwide across all industries. She has spent 15 years working with the CIO community at the highest levels. Based on this experience and extensive interviews, outreach, and her work as an executive recruiter, Martha has distilled empirically backed insights into what it takes today to be an IT executive capable of driving transformation. <br><br>In 2004, Martha founded the CIO Executive Council, <i>CIO</i> magazine&#x2019;s professional organization for CIOs. In addition to her blog on CIO.com, Martha engages extensively with the technology executive community through social media and her widely read e-newsletter, The Heller Report.&#x201d;<br><br>Martha is a highly sought after public speaker, regularly addressing and engaging with members of the IT profession at executive events held by The Research Board, the National Retail Federation, the Technology Business Management Council, Forrester, Harvard University, MIT, <i>CIO</i> magazine, ServiceNow, Box, and Cisco.<br><br><b>Maryfran Johnson</b> Award-winning IT journalist and editorial executive, Editor-in-Chief of <i>CIO</i> magazine.<br>"In "The CIO Paradox", Heller has her finger on the pulse of the major contradictions that plague the CIO role today, including being hired to be strategic, but spending most of our time being operational. Her recommendations on how to overcome major paradoxes offer concise and helpful advice to CIOs on becoming more successful in the role." (Gregory S. Smith, CIO at an international firm, and author of "Straight to the Top: Becoming a World-Class CIO")<br><br>"In "The CIO Paradox", Martha Heller has clearly articulated the many contradictions that permeate the CIO role. But more than that, she includes rich examples of how successful CIOs have managed to break through these contradictions. IT leadership is a balancing act, as Heller demonstrates in this entertaining and insightful book." (Carol Zierhoffer, VP &amp; Global CIO, Xerox)<br><br>"Martha does a great job of capturing the paradox of not just the CIO role, but of Enterprise IT as a whole. In a world that greatly admires technology and over-rewards the start-up, how is the "brand" of the enterprise CIO and the technology teams that support our business so weak? As a CIO that has survived this paradox for more than a decade, I appreciate the insights of "The CIO Paradox"." (Robert B. Carter, EVP &amp; CIO, FedEx Corporation)<br><br>"Martha Heller has captured the essence of the exhilaration and the stress that come with being a CIO in the 21st century. In "The CIO Paradox", she has articulated the complex and critical set of issues that confront CIOs every day, in every enterprise, in a witty and constructive way. Having lived the CIO role over four different decades, I was able to relate to her paradoxes and her conclusions: that to be successful in this young and great profession you must move from being an "either, or" manager to an "and, and" leader. It will be exciting to see more and more of our next generation leaders break through these paradoxes." (Charlie Feld, Founder, The Feld Group Institute, and author of "Blind Spot IT: A Leader's Guide To IT-Enabled Business Transformation")<br><br>"What makes "The CIO Paradox" a compelling read is the understanding Martha has of the vast challenges today's CIOs are faced with. Throughout the book you have those "aha!" moments that energize any reader who works in or supports the IT profession. The organized, blunt fashion in which she states the paradox, while injecting the perfect amount of humor, is terrific, as are her conclusions. This is not a book about IT that will bore you!"

McCabe, SVP &amp; CIO, Delphi)</p><h2>Why Does College Cost So Much?</h2><p>Much of what is written about colleges and universities ties rapidly rising tuition to dysfunctional behavior in the academy. Common targets of dysfunction include prestige games among universities, gold plated amenities, and bloated administration. This book offers a different view. To explain rising college cost, the authors place the higher education industry firmly within the larger economic history of the United States. The trajectory of college cost is similar to cost behavior in many other industries, and this is no coincidence. Higher education is a personal service that relies on highly educated labor. A technological trio of broad economic forces has come together in the last thirty years to cause higher education costs, and costs in many other industries, to rise much more rapidly than the inflation rate. The main culprit is economic growth itself.<br><br>This finding does not mean that all is well in American higher education. A college education has become less reachable to a broad swathe of the American public at the same time that the market demand for highly educated people has soared. This affordability problem has deep roots. The authors explore how cost pressure, the changing wage structure of the US economy, and the complexity of financial aid policy combine to reduce access to higher education below what we need in the 21st century labor market. <br><br>This book is a call to calm the rhetoric of blame and to instead find policies that will increase access to higher education while preserving the quality of our colleges and universities.<br></p><p><br>Robert B.

Health care, social services, education, law enforcement, and other fields have established their own standards against which program operations are assessed. National accrediting bodies have implemented systems of rigorous peer review to ensure the quality of program processes and outcomes. Nongovernmental organizations must demonstrate success in achieving their stated goals in order to sustain or expand program funding. In the 21st century, process (how programs are organized and how work is conducted) has become as important as outcomes in determining program effectiveness.<p> Responding to these dynamic challenges, the authors utilize concrete case studies to immerse students in the techniques of program evaluation. They effectively examine systems theory, project planning, queuing theory, cost-benefit analysis, and organization processes (including standards-based program accreditation), providing practical examples in an easy-to-comprehend style. In addition, comprehensive discussions explain how process intervention is utilized to achieve program adaptations and strategic change. Like its highly regarded predecessors, the latest edition features evaluation exercises designed to facilitate student development of indicators and measures when dealing with real-world programs.</p><p> Not-for-sale instructor resource material available to college and university faculty only; contact publisher directly.</p><p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Johnson, <i>Public Administration: Partnerships in Public Service,</i> Fifth Edition (ISBN 9781478610908); Stojkovic et al., <i>The Administration and Management of Criminal Justice Organizations: A Book of Readings,</i> Fifth Edition (ISBN 9781577666394); and Welch-Comer, <i>Quantitative Methods for Public Administration: Techniques and Applications,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9781577664932).</p></p><p></p><h2>Case Study Research (Strategies for Social Inquiry)</h2><p>Case Study Research: Principles and Practices provides a general understanding of the case study method as well as specific tools for its successful implementation.

Even as we approach its fiftieth anniversary, the movement remains so contentious that the Chinese Communist Party still forbids fully open investigation of its origins, development, and conclusion. Drawing upon a vital trove of scholarship, memoirs, and popular culture, this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> illuminates this complex, often obscure, and still controversial movement. Moving beyond the figure of Mao Zedong, Richard Curt Kraus links Beijing's elite politics to broader aspects of society and culture, highlighting many changes in daily life, employment, and the economy. Kraus also situates this very nationalist outburst of Chinese radicalism within a global context, showing that the Cultural Revolution was mirrored in the radical youth movement that swept much of the world, and that had imagined or emotional links to China's red guards. Yet it was also during the Cultural Revolution that China and the United States tempered their long hostility, one of the innovations in this period that sowed the seeds for China's subsequent decades of spectacular economic growth.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Curt Kraus</strong> is Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Oregon and the author of <em>Pianos and Politics in China</em>.<br><br>"This remarkably full and efficient account provides a basic narrative of the Cultural Revolution, and then discusses in greater depth its politics, culture, economics, foreign relations, and memory.

White, European Americans living in the United States will soon share an unprecedented experience of slipping below 50% of the population. The impending demographic shifts are already felt in most urban centers and the effect is a national backlash of hyper-mobilized political, and sometimes violent, activism with a stated aim that is simultaneously vague and deadly clear: 'to take our country back.' Meanwhile the spectre of 'minority status' draws closer, and the material advantages of being born white are eroding. <br>&nbsp;<br>This is the political and cultural reality tackled by Linda Mart�n Alcoff in The Future of Whiteness. She argues that whiteness is here to stay, at least for a while, but that half of whites have given up on ideas of white supremacy, and the shared public, material culture is more integrated than ever. More and more, whites are becoming aware of how they appear to non-whites, both at home and abroad, and this is having profound effects on white identity in North America. The young generation of whites today, as well as all those who follow, will have never known a country in which they could take white identity as the unchallenged default that dominates the political, economic and cultural leadership. Change is on the horizon, and the most important battleground is among white people themselves.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Future of Whiteness makes no predictions but astutely analyzes the present reaction and evaluates the current signs of turmoil. Beautifully written and cogently argued, the book looks set to spark debate in the field and to illuminate an important area of racial politics.</p><p>Linda Martin Alcoff is Professor of Philosophy at Hunter College<p>"A profound meditation on 'whiteness' &#x2013; its past, its present, and its possible future - by one of our leading scholars of race.

Internet of Things is a new revolution of the Internet that is rapidly gathering momentum driven by the advancements in sensor networks, mobile devices, wireless communications, networking and cloud technologies. Experts forecast that by the year 2020 there will be a total of 50 billion devices/things connected to the internet. <br><br> This book is written as a textbook on Internet of Things for educational programs at colleges and universities, and also for IoT vendors and service providers who may be interested in offering a broader perspective of Internet of Things to accompany their own customer and developer training programs. The typical reader is expected to have completed a couple of courses in programming using traditional high-level languages at the college-level, and is either a senior or a beginning graduate student in one of the science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. Like our companion book on Cloud Computing, we have tried to write a comprehensive book that transfers knowledge through an immersive "hands on" approach, where the reader is provided the necessary guidance and knowledge to develop working code for real-world IoT applications. <br><br> Additional support is available at the book's website: hands-on-books-series.com<br> <b>Organization</b><br> The book is organized into 3 main parts, comprising of a total of 11 chapters. Part I covers the building blocks of Internet of Things (IoTs) and their characteristics. A taxonomy of IoT systems is proposed comprising of various IoT levels with increasing levels of complexity. Domain specific Internet of Things and their real-world applications are described. A generic design methodology for IoT is proposed. An IoT system management approach using NETCONF-YANG is described. Part II introduces the reader to the programming aspects of Internet of Things with a view towards rapid prototyping of complex IoT applications. We chose Python as the primary programming language for this book, and an introduction to Python is also included within the text to bring readers to a common level of expertise. We describe packages, frameworks and cloud services including the WAMP-AutoBahn, Xively cloud and Amazon Web Services which can be used for developing IoT systems. We chose the Raspberry Pi device for the examples in this book. Reference architectures for different levels of IoT applications are examined in detail. Case studies with complete source code for various IoT domains including home automation, smart environment, smart cities, logistics, retail, smart energy, smart agriculture, industrial control and smart health, are described. Part III introduces the reader to advanced topics on IoT including IoT data analytics and Tools for IoT.

This edition is intended to provide students of Latin literature with guidance in the interpretation of these poems. The Introduction also includes a general account of Ovid&#39;s career and the place of the Heroides in the development of Augustan poetry.</p><p>The Heroides are a collection of letters in alegiac verse supposedly addressed by heroines of mythology to their absent lovers or husbands. Intended to provide the student with guidance in interpretation, this text includes the first full-scale English commentary in this century on a selection of the Heroides.Ovid&#39;s Heroides, Dryden once asserted, are &#39;generally granted to be the most perfect piece of Ovid&#39;. The collection of twenty-one epistles in elegiac verse consists of three parts, the first comprising fourteen poems addressed by heroines of mythology to their absent lovers or husbands. In this edition, Professor Knox offers a commentary on seven of these epistles, addressing problems of language and style, and focusing on the relationship of the Heroides to the classic works of Greek and Roman literature on which Ovid bases his representation of these women. In addition, he has included a commentary on the Epistula Sapphus, a separate poem of doubtful authorship which was composed in the manner of Ovid and is believed by many to be by him. The Introduction provides an account of the genre, a survey of language, style, and metre, and an outline of the problems concerning the authenticity of parts of the collection. This edition is intended primarily for students and scholars in classics, but the Introduction contains material of interest to readers who are not specialists in Latin literature.</p><h2>Ethics and the Future of Spying: Technology, National Security and Intelligence Collection (Studies in Intelligence)</h2><p><p>This volume examines the ethical issues generated by recent developments in intelligence collection and offers a comprehensive analysis of the key legal, moral and social questions thereby raised.</p> <p>Intelligence officers, whether gatherers, analysts or some combination thereof, are operating in a sea of social, political, scientific and technological change. This book examines the new challenges faced by the intelligence community as a result of these changes. It looks not only at how governments employ spies as a tool of state and how the ultimate outcomes are judged by their societies, but also at the mind-set of the spy. In so doing, this volume casts a rare light on an often ignored dimension of spying: the essential role of truth and how it is defined in an intelligence context. This book offers some insights into the workings of the intelligence community and aims to provide the first comprehensive and unifying analysis of the relevant moral, legal and social questions, with a view toward developing policy that may influence real-world decision making. The contributors analyse the ethics of spying across a broad canvas &#x2013; historical, philosophical, moral and cultural &#x2013; with chapters covering interrogation and torture, intelligence&#x2019;s relation to war, remote killing, cyber surveillance, responsibility and governance. In the wake of the phenomena of WikiLeaks and the Edward Snowden revelations, the intelligence community has entered an unprecedented period of broad public scrutiny and scepticism, making this volume a timely contribution. </p> <p>This book will be of much interest to students of ethics, intelligence studies, security studies, foreign policy and IR in general.</p></p><p><p><strong>Jai Galliott</strong> is Research Fellow at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.

If by some catastrophe maize were to disappear from our food supply chain, vast numbers of people would starve and global economies would rapidly collapse. How did we come to be so dependent on this one plant?<br><br><i>Maize for the Gods</i> brings together new research by archaeologists, archaeobotanists, plant geneticists, and a host of other specialists to explore the complex ways that this single plant and the peoples who domesticated it came to be inextricably entangled with one another over the past nine millennia. Tracing maize from its first appearance and domestication in ancient campsites and settlements in Mexico to its intercontinental journey through most of North and South America, this history also tells the story of the artistic creativity, technological prowess, and social, political, and economic resilience of America&#x2019;s first peoples.</p><p>"This volume is an amazing summary of our current knowledge of the Americas' greatest contribution to world cuisine.

L. Austin, and extended by Stanley Cavell&#x2014;to transform literary studies. In engaging and lucid prose, Toril Moi demonstrates this philosophy&#x2019;s unique ability to lay bare the connections between words and the world, dispel the notion of literature as a monolithic concept, and teach readers how to learn from a literary text.<br> <br> Moi first introduces Wittgenstein&#x2019;s vision of language and theory, which refuses to reduce language to a matter of naming or representation, considers theory&#x2019;s desire for generality doomed to failure, and brings out the philosophical power of the particular case. Contrasting ordinary language philosophy with dominant strands of Saussurean and post-Saussurean thought, she highlights the former&#x2019;s originality, critical power, and potential for creative use. Finally, she challenges the belief that good critics always read below the surface, proposing instead an innovative view of texts as expression and action, and of reading as an act of acknowledgment. Intervening in cutting-edge debates while bringing Wittgenstein, Austin, and Cavell to new readers, <i>Revolution of the Ordinary</i> will appeal beyond literary studies to anyone looking for a philosophically serious account of why words matter.</p></p><p><b>Toril Moi</b> is the James B. Duke Professor of Literature and Romance Studies, with additional appointments in theater studies, English, and philosophy, at Duke University. Her books include <i>Sexual/Textual Politics: Feminist Literary Theory</i> and <i>Henrik Ibsen and the Birth of Modernism: Art, Theater, Philosophy</i>.&#x201c;<i>Revolution of the Ordinary</i> is a milestone in literary studies. In lucid and invigorating prose, Moi shows how a certain picture of &#x2018;literary theory&#x2019; has held us captive and offers a brilliant and devastating analysis of its weaknesses. Drawing on the tradition of ordinary language philosophy, she offers a new vision of how we might think and read. This groundbreaking book will shape conversations among literary scholars for years to come.&#x201d; (Rita Felski, author of The Limits of Critique)<br><br>"<i>Revolution of the Ordinary</i> takes on the formidable challenge of making Wittgenstein understandable and brilliantly shows his work&#x2019;s relevance for critics educated in post-Structuralist, Lacanian, deconstructive, new historicist, culturalist, postcolonial, queer, feminist, and critical race theories. The growing interest in Wittgenstein among both literary critics and contemporary writers and poets absolutely demands this book.&#x201d; (R. M. Berry, Florida State University)<br><br>&#x201c;This is an agenda-setting work by a preeminent literary theorist. It is also tremendously fun to read. <i>Revolution of the Ordinary</i> is the kind of book that tells literary scholars and philosophers how to repair their relationship, and how to do so without losing what is distinctive about each discipline.&#x201d; (John Gibson, University of Louisville)<br><br>"Drawing on the ordinary language philosophy of Wittgenstein, Cavell, and (to a lesser degree) Austin, Moi offers a compelling argument that the Saussurean project is backward: one cannot develop a&nbsp;theory&nbsp;of language because language is indeterminate; instead, use determines meaning. Writing in perspicuous prose, the author guides the reader through the basics of ordinary language philosophy and demonstrates how a Wittgensteinian attention to specific examples of ordinary use offers a radical and liberating method for approaching texts. Moi advocates moving beyond the cynicism of the 'hermeneutics of suspicion' (Ricoeur's coinage) as she traces a fresh approach to reading the world. A bold reassessment of literary studies after theory, and a project one can hope will revolutionize inquiry into rhetoric...Essential." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[Moi's] important new book, <i>Revolution of the Ordinary</i>, makes a case for rejecting the approach to language that the 'theory project' produced. . .beyond challenging the ways that literary studies thinks about language, Moi challenges the distinction between literature and life.&#x201d; (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The most important aspect of Moi&#x2019;s approach. . .is that she is proposing OLP not as another (or a better) theory, but as a rejection of the idea of a theory for such matters, an alternative to reliance on theory. . .And yet, a major implication of Moi&#x2019;s approach is true: the latter assessment is subject to no method of resolution, can appeal to no decision procedure for telling whether an experience bears any of the adjectives suggested by Cavell or not.&nbsp; And such reflection is no exemplification of any theory. Nothing is more important than insisting on both the distinction and on this point, in as many ways and as forcefully as possible; and that is what Toril Moi has done in this lucid book.&#x201d; (<i>Critical Inquiry</i>)<br><br>"Toril Moi&#x2019;s <i>Revolution of the Ordinary</i> is probably the most important work of literary crit�icism published this century. Its audacious title isn&#x2019;t at all misplaced: Moi&#x2019;s intervention is genuinely revolutionary, with wide-ranging im�plications for literary critics of all kinds. Her goal is nothing less than a transformation of the field as it currently stands. . .It's hard to overstate just how provocative and valuable <i>Revolution of the Ordinary</i> really is. . .and will surely inspire readers to recalibrate their thinking on a wide range of questions." (<i>Australasian Journal of American Studies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Toril Moi&#x2019;s new book about the relevance of what she calls &#x2018;ordinary language philosophy&#x2019; to literary studies is clear, intelligent, and thought-provoking. If the revolutionary implications of what she says are taken on board it would undoubtedly transform literary studies for the better. . . It should stimulate both more fruitful work in literary theory and interesting debates about literature, reading, authors, and texts amongst philosophers.&#x201d; (<i>Nordic Wittgenstein Review</i>)<br><br>"Toril Moi is right: &#x2018;It is difficult to write about Wittgenstein&#x2019;s philosophy&#x2019;. . .It helps to have guides to figure this out, and Moi, in her new book, is one of the best. . . it&#x2019;s also true that someone must show you how to read Wittgenstein. Even better, you need someone to show you how to let Wittgenstein show you how to read him. The beauty of this book, in which reading plays such an important role, is that it does that elegantly, with carefully wrought, eminently comprehensible prose.&#x201d; (<i>Modern Philology</i>)</p><h2>Rhetorical Style: The Uses of Language in Persuasion</h2><p>A comprehensive guide to the language of argument, <em>Rhetorical Style</em> offers a renewed appreciation of the persuasive power of the English language. Drawing on key texts from the rhetorical tradition, as well as on newer approaches from linguistics and literary stylistics, Fahnestock demonstrates how word choice, sentence form, and passage construction can combine to create effective spoken and written arguments. With examples from political speeches, non-fiction works, and newspaper reports, Rhetorical Style surveys the arguer's options at the word, sentence, interactive, and passage levels, and illustrates the enduring usefulness of rhetorical stylistics in analyzing and constructing arguments.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jeanne Fahnestock</strong> is Professor of English at the University of Maryland.

Evidence-based medicine has also begun to influence the field of mental health. As support for evidence-based medicine grows in mental health, the need to clarify its fundamental principles also increases. In dealing with the new era of evidence-based practice, mental health practitioners are now confronted with a sense of obligation to understand these practices and to implement them in order to provide the best available services to consumers. This book explores some of the complex challenges in implementing EBPs, and highlights the meaningful opportunities that are inherent in this paradigm shift. This comprehensive textbook will become an essential primer for all practitioners and students who are grappling with the new age of evidence-based practice.</p><p><p><strong>Robert E.

In his sweeping account, Ben Kiernan broadens this vision by narrating the rich history of the peoples who have inhabited the land now known as Viet Nam over the past three thousand years. <br><br>Despite the tragedies of the American-Vietnamese conflict, Viet Nam has always been much more than a war. Its long history had been characterized by the frequent rise and fall of different political formations, from ancient chiefdoms to imperial provinces, from independent kingdoms to divided regions, civil wars, French colonies, and modern republics. In addition to dramatic political transformations, the region has been shaped by its environment, changing climate, and the critical importance of water, with rivers, deltas, and a long coastline facilitating agricultural patterns, trade, and communications. <br><br>Kiernan weaves together the many narrative strands of Viet Nam's multi-ethnic populations, including the Chams, Khmers, and Vietnamese, and its multi-religious heritage, from local spirit cults to Buddhism, Confucianism, and Catholicism. He emphasizes the peoples' interactions over the millennia with foreigners, particularly their neighbors in China and Southeast Asia, in engagements ranging from military conflict to linguistic and cultural influences. He sets the tumultuous modern period--marked by French and Japanese occupation, anticolonial nationalism, the American-Vietnamese war, and communist victory--against the continuities evident in the deeper history of the people's relationships with the lands where they have lived. In contemporary times, he explores this one-party state's transformation into a global trading nation, the country's tense diplomatic relationship with China and developing partnership with the United States in maintaining Southeast Asia's regional security, and its uncertain prospects for democracy.<br><br>Written by a leading scholar of Southeast Asia, <em>Viet Nam </em>presents an authoritative history of an ancient land.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ben Kiernan</strong> is the A.

It is a work full of insights for students of Southeast Asia generally and, more specifically, for comparative historians and political scientists interested in nationalism, anti-colonialism, US foreign policy, and the reform and modernisation of socialism. By taking the long view, the author successfully liberates the history of Viet Nam from the reductionist view of a US military misadventure, revealing long-term trends in political organisation, culture and environmental changes." -- Vicken Cheterian, University of Geneva and Webster University Geneva, <em>Europe-Asia Studies</em><p></p><br>"Comprehensive yet readable ... It will serve the needs of both experts in Vietnamese history and general readers interested in Vietnam.... <em>Viet Nam</em>'s ability to integrate ecology into political, cultural and economic history is truly impressive." -- Michael G. Vann, <em> Asian Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"Kiernan departs from nationalist narratives to investigate the changing cultural, political, and ecological relations of the multiethnic communities that inhabited the diverse regions of Vietnam. His deep historical study exposes the folly of reducing Vietnam to a war, a metaphor of US imperialism, or the experiences of one ethnicity. Adopting a long-term approach that combines microhistory and macrohistory to decipher the multicausal forces driving historical processes, the author examines a time span of 3,000 years, beginning with the first Bronze Age chiefdoms and ending with the changing fortunes of the contemporary nation-state....The analysis is innovative for incorporating the roles of climate, water, and geography in explanations of historical continuity or change and for making ample use of archaeological and textual source materials. Valuable for both newcomers and experts in Vietnamese history. Highly recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"This ambitious survey is pathbreaking not only in its chronological scope (from prehistory to the present) and the breadth of its sources but also in its thematic reach....Although the war against the United States is an important part of Vietnam's story, it takes its place in the broad sweep of history as just one episode in a long series of struggles that people have waged over this piece of land."--Andrew J. Nathan, <em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"[In] this major new history of the country...Kiernan makes the actualities of Vietnamese life and landscape a central focus...Where Kiernan excels is in his engagement with the complex cultural and environmental factors that make the country so distinctive. In particular, he highlights the country's 'aquatic culture' from prehistoric times right up to this day...[He] makes sure that Vietnamese women themselves are heard in his narrative and are not simply defined by men...Kiernan's readiness to detect and define the significant details lurking in the sweeping historical panorama, make <em>Viet Nam</em> a major contribution to contemporary Southeast Asian scholarship...[A] sympathetic study of a tenacious and capable people."--Robin Gerster, <em>Australian Book Review</em><p></p><br>"This is a remarkably evocative, multifaceted, sophisticated, and original study not only of those groups who haltingly coalesced as Vietnamese, but also of the many peoples with whom they interacted, and indeed of an entire region during two millennia. This book, I suspect, will become a classic in Asian as well as Southeast Asian historiography."--Victor Lieberman, University of Michigan<p></p><br>"An audacious book, Kiernan's <em>Viet Nam</em> presents the country's long history to new, global audiences, eloquently showing how the deep past continues to shape and inform the present."--David Biggs, author of <em>Quagmire: Nation-Building and Nature in the Mekong Delta</em> <br><p></p><br>"This outstanding book shows that '<em>Viet Nam</em> has always been much more than a war.' By making his themes the perennial continuities and changes in the vital ecologies and polyethnic cultures of the country, Ben Kiernan tells a story of shifting layers that is lucid and rich. His work is a kaleidoscope of Vietnamese history."--Greg Lockhart, author of <em>Nation in Arms: the Origins of the People's Army of Vietnam</em><p></p><br>"Kiernan offers a comprehensive overview of Vietnamese history from prehistoric times to the 21st century...A distinctive quality of this work is its inclusion of environmental and linguistic history. The author effectively explains how geography and changing weather patterns (droughts, etc.) impacted historical development and demonstrates how changes in language over time provides information about Vietnam's past...Essential for all students of Vietnamese history. Extensive descriptions of Vietnam's relations with its neighbors also make this valuable reading for those interested in Chinese or Southeast Asian history."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Paperback Oxford Canadian Dictionary</h2><p>Based on the critically acclaimed and best-selling <em>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</em>m the <em>Paperback Oxford Canadian Dictionary</em> offers all the authority of Oxford's flagship Canadian dictionary in a handy and affordable format. <br><br> With 200,000 words, phrases, and definitions, it features over 1,800 uniquely Canadian words and senses.

Like the first edition, the second concludes with several appendixes: a six-page style guide, a list of the prime ministers and governors general of Canada, weights and measures (Canada measures using the metric system), a short history of the English language, and the Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, and Russian alphabets.</p><p>The COD is a must for any U.S. library close to the Canadian border and for academic institutions with Canadian studies programs (or <i>programmes</i>). Canadian libraries will want to update their reference collections with this latest edition, which is also a worthy edition to any Canadian home reference collection. <i>Terri Tomchyshyn</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Its history is intimately linked to the political upheavals of modernity: from colonial empire-building in the nineteenth century to the postcolonial culture wars of the twenty-first century, attempts at "comparison" have defined the international agenda of literature. But what is comparative literature? Ambitious readers looking to stretch themselves are usually intrigued by the concept, but uncertain of its implications. And rightly so, in many ways: even the professionals cannot agree on a single term, calling it comparative in English, compared in French, and comparing in German. The very term itself, when approached comparatively, opens up a Pandora's box of cultural differences. <br><br>Yet this, in a nutshell, is the whole point of comparative literature. To look at literature comparatively is to realize just how much can be learned by looking over the horizon of one's own culture. In an age that is paradoxically defined by migration and border crossing on the one hand, and by a retreat into monolingualism and monoculturalism on the other, the cross-cultural agenda of comparative literature has become increasingly central to the future of the Humanities. We are all, in fact, comparatists, constantly making connections across languages, cultures, and genres as we read. The question is whether we realize it.<br><br>Outlining the complex history and competing theories of comparative literature, Ben Hutchinson offers an accessible means of entry into a notoriously slippery subject. Ultimately, he places comparative literature at the very heart of literary criticism, for as George Steiner once noted, "to read is to compare."<br><strong></strong> ABOUT THE SERIES: The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

This commentary analyzes 1 and 2 Corinthians passage by passage, in accordance with Paul&#39;s argument, and draws from ancient letter-writing, speaking and social conventions to demonstrate how meaningful to first-century readers it would have been. The commentary will interest pastors, teachers, and scholars because of its exploration of ancient sources, often not previously cited in commentaries.</p><p>Despite Paul&#39;s special pastoral relationship with the church in Corinth, he confronted numerous local and cultural problems in this church inviting correction.

Hyde's primary teaching tool, High Level Assembler (or HLA), incorporates many of the features found in high-level languages (like C, C++, and Java) to help you quickly grasp basic assembly concepts. HLA lets you write true low-level code while enjoying the benefits of high-level language programming.</p> <p>As you read <em>The Art of Assembly Language</em>, you'll learn the low-level theory fundamental to computer science and turn that understanding into real, functional code. You'll learn how to:</p> <ul> <li>Edit, compile, and run an HLA program</li> <li>Declare and use constants, scalar variables, pointers, arrays, structures, unions, and namespaces</li> <li>Translate arithmetic expressions (integer and floating point)</li> <li>Convert high-level control structures</li> </ul> <p>This much anticipated second edition of <em>The Art of Assembly Language</em> has been updated to reflect recent changes to HLA and to support Linux, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD. Whether you're new to programming or you have experience with high-level languages, <em>The Art of Assembly Language, 2nd Edition</em> is your essential guide to learning this complex, low-level language.</p></p><p><b>Randall Hyde</b> is the author of <i>Write Great Code</i> Volumes 1 and 2 (No Starch Press) and the co-author of <i>MASM 6.0 Bible</i> (The Waite Group). He has written for Dr. Dobb's Journal, Byte, and various professional journals.

It was first published as a book in 1850. Many elements of the novel follow events in Dickens&#39; own life, and it is probably the most autobiographical of his novels. In the preface to the 1867 edition, Dickens wrote, &#34;like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.&#34; The story traces the life of David Copperfield from childhood to maturity. David was born in Blunderstone, Suffolk, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, in 1820, six months after the death of his father. David spends his early years in relative happiness with his loving but frail mother and their kindly housekeeper, Peggotty. When he is seven years old his mother marries Edward Murdstone. David is given good reason to dislike his stepfather and has similar feelings for Murdstone&#39;s sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Murdstone attempts to thrash David for falling behind in his studies. David bites him and soon afterwards is sent away to a boarding school, Salem House, with a ruthless headmaster, Mr. Creakle. The novel has been adapted into several plays and for the screen at least twelve times.</p><p>Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world&#39;s best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity. Growing up in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors&#39; prison. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children&#39;s rights, education, and other social reforms. A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, David Copperfield, The Old Curiosity Shop and Bleak House are among his most famous and popular works.</p><h2>Native Hubs: Culture, Community, and Belonging in Silicon Valley and Beyond</h2><p>Most Native Americans in the United States live in cities, where many find themselves caught in a bind, neither afforded the full rights granted U.S. citizens nor allowed full access to the tribal programs and resources&#x2014;particularly health care services&#x2014;provided to Native Americans living on reservations. A scholar and a member of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, Renya K. Ramirez investigates how urban Native Americans negotiate what she argues is, in effect, a transnational existence. Through an ethnographic account of the Native American community in California&#x2019;s Silicon Valley and beyond, Ramirez explores the ways that urban Indians have pressed their tribes, local institutions, and the federal government to expand conventional notions of citizenship.<p></p><p>Ramirez&#x2019;s ethnography revolves around the Paiute American activist Laverne Roberts&#x2019;s notion of the &#x201c;hub,&#x201d; a space that allows for the creation of a sense of belonging away from a geographic center. Ramirez describes &#x201c;hub-making&#x201d; activities in Silicon Valley, including sweat lodge ceremonies, powwows, and American Indian Alliance meetings, gatherings at which urban Indians reinforce bonds of social belonging and forge intertribal alliances. She examines the struggle of the Muwekma Ohlone, a tribe aboriginal to the San Francisco Bay area, to maintain a sense of community without a land base and to be recognized as a tribe by the federal government. She considers the crucial role of Native women within urban indigenous communities; a 2004 meeting in which Native Americans from Mexico and the United States discussed cross-border indigenous rights activism; and the ways that young Native Americans in Silicon Valley experience race and ethnicity, especially in relation to the area&#x2019;s large Chicano community. A unique and important exploration of diaspora, transnationalism, identity, belonging, and community, <i>Native Hubs</i> is intended for scholars and activists alike.</p></p><p>&#34;Renya K. Ramirez makes compelling use of ethnographic interviews to explore broad issues of cultural citizenship and transnational migration. Her analysis of Laverne Roberts&#39;s notion of &#39;hubs&#39; connecting Native people across time and space is a significant contribution to the all too sparse scholarship on urban American Indian communities.&#34;--Susan Applegate Krouse, Director of the American Indian Studies Program, Michigan State University<p>Renya K.

This ten-volume set containing more than 1,000 photographs is drawn from a body of 12,000 pictures made by Eggleston in the 1980s. Following an opening volume of work in Louisiana, the ensuing volumes cover Eggleston's travels from his familiar ground in Memphis and Tennessee out to Dallas, Pittsburgh, Miami and Boston, the pastures of Kentucky and as far as the Berlin Wall. The final volume leads the viewer back to the South of small towns, cotton fields, the Civil War battlefield of Shiloh and the home of Andrew Jackson in Tennessee. <br>The "democratic" in Eggleston's title refers to a democracy of vision, through which the most mundane subjects are represented with the same complexity and significance as the most elevated. This work has rarely been shown and only a fraction of the entire oeuvre has ever been published; the exhaustive editing process has taken over three years. This gorgeous set includes a new introduction by Mark Holborn and the republication of Eudora Welty's original essay on the work.<br><b>William Eggleston</b> was born in 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee. He took his first black-and-white photographs at age 18. His first color work was shot in 1964 in color negative film, but in the late 60s he began to use color slides. Eggleston was the subject of a landmark solo exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1976.</p><p>But to look at his photographs again, especially now, and even the ones you think you know well, is to induce a fresh vision. You stop being able to see the world the way you once did; you start seeing Egglestons everywhere. (Rebecca Bengal <i>Vogue</i>)<br><br>In his hands, the camera becomes a palpable, itinerant presence; the scope feels restless, filmic. Nothing was off limits, and nothing mattered more than anything else. The image of a child&#x2019;s face&#x2015;even the face of his own child&#x2015;carried no more photographic weight than a rusted car door. That car door could be freighted with just as much feeling as one of the luminous large-format portraits: artistically, Eggleston approached and treated them the same. (Rebecca Bengal <i>Vogue</i>)<br><br>Taken as a whole, this enormous collection is kind of like bellying up to a luxurious buffet&#x2015;it's delicious, and overwhelming, but worth the heartburn. (Mark Murrmann <i>Mother Jones</i>)<br><br>The images are democratic in the sense of how varied and inclusive they are. Eggleston shoots parked cars, flower vases, cemeteries, gas stations and piles of dirt, and each photograph in these long, glorious sequences (there are 10 volumes in all, with titles like &#x201c;Pittsburgh,&#x201d; &#x201c;Berlin&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Pastoral&#x201d;) merits its place. There are few photographers whose images I would wish to see more than a thousand of in a single sitting. Eggleston is easily in that class. (Teju Cole <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>)<br><br>The year&#x2019;s major, massive photographic event... Whittled down to just 150 pictures in full, saturated Egglestonian color when it was published in 1989, the book now stretches to a vast expanse of images, most never before published, vividly illustrating his definition of what it means to photograph democratically&#x2015;in other words, everything. (Rebecca Bengal <i>Vogue</i>)<br><br>As fresh as the present moment (John Gossage <i>Photo-Eye Blog, Best of 2016</i>)<br><br>One of America&#x2019;s greatest living photographers...Eggleston&#x2019;s sensitivity to light and color, and to a peculiarly American melancholy, links his pictures to the paintings of Edward Hopper; far from creating a flat hierarchy of images, he revels in the glorious specificity of each one. (<i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>William Eggleston is partial to impartiality. He professes to have no favorite photographs or subjects...his distinctive images float free of titles...What remains is hauntingly clear and vividly colored: the strangely obvious made obviously strange (Stephanie Murg <i>The Line</i>)<br><br>Expect trademark mastery of dappled light and keen yet gentle observations from the master of modern photography. (Amah-Rose Abrams <i>Artnet</i>)<br><br>These moments in Eggleston&#x2019;s work offer a fitting crystallization of his work, and more broadly, the act of seeing itself. Letting light play such a strong hand in his pieces, each work underscores his ability to capture moments of visual harmony, where the viewer is equally aware of the world just beyond the lens, as they are in the elements shaping it, and the act of seeing it in turn. At each point, Eggleston&#x2019;s own hand rarely seems to enter too explicitly into view, a note that emphasizes his mastery all the more loudly. (D. Creahon <i>Arts Observer</i>)</p><h2>Understanding Islam and Christianity: Beliefs That Separate Us and How to Talk About Them</h2><p><p>For years, international apologist Josh McDowell has been alert to the challenge of Islam&#x2015;and how Muslims&#x2019; objections to Christianity can raise deep doubts in believers&#x2019; minds. His recent on-the-ground research with Muslims in the Middle East has crystallized into this practical resource focusing on Jesus and the gospel. Aided by Islam expert Jim Walker, McDowell lays out the evidence on the crucial issues:</p><ul><li>What kind of prophet was Jesus? Was he the Messiah?</li><li>&#x201c;Son of God&#x201d;? &#x201c;Son of Man&#x201d;? What&#x2019;s that about?</li><li>How are God and Jesus related?

What good did his death do?</li><li>Aren&#x2019;t the Bible&#x2019;s accounts of Jesus corrupt?</li></ul><p>With all this, as well as backgrounder appendixes on the basics, believers will have authoritative evidence from Scripture and history to intelligently deal with Muslims&#x2019; questions about and challenges to Christianity.</p></p><p><p><b>Josh McDowell</b> has been reaching the spiritually skeptical for more than five decades.

Man meets Woman</h2><p><p>Imagine a setting in which a man wearing a dress might be as habitual as a woman in trousers. Where a woman exposing herself in public wasn&#x2019;t sexy, but as creepy as a male flasher. Where professional status and success presented the same prospects for both sexes.</p><p>In this first in a new series for TASCHEN, leading graphic designer Yang Liu tackles one of the hottest, and one of the oldest, topics of all: he and she. Drawing on the experiences, challenges, and many perspectives on men and women she has encountered in her own life, Yang Liu distills the vast, swirling question of gender into bold, binary pictograms.</p><p>Dealing with a whole host of situations from the bedroom to the boardroom, Yang Liu&#x2019;s designs are as simple and accessible in their presentation as they are infinite in the associations, evocations, and responses they elicit. Combining age-old stereotypes with topical discrepancies, this fresh approach to the roles and relationships of men and women is, above all, an effort to synthesize a notoriously thorny issue into a fun and refreshing graphic form, and thus to lighten and enlighten our mutual understanding and tolerance.</p></p><p>Yang Liu was born in 1976 in Beijing. After studying at the University of Arts Berlin (UdK), she worked as a designer in Singapore, London, Berlin and New York. In 2004 she founded her own design studio, which she continues to run today.

Beauty invites us to build bridges and make connections between the senses and the soul, between contemplation and expression, between ourselves and the world." In this wide-ranging and deeply felt book, artist and writer J. Ruth Gendler invites us to reclaim and celebrate the often misunderstood quality of beauty as one of the most profound and essential forces in our lives. Drawing upon observations from art and mythology, science and nature, contemporary culture and personal experience, the author looks at her subject in its most generous implications &#x2014; not simply as a reflection of surface and image, but as a pathway to wholeness, integrity, coherence, and ultimately, to love. Written with curiosity, courage, a discerning eye and a lyrical sensibility, and illustrated with evocative line drawings by the author, Notes on the Need for Beauty displays the strong personal voice that has made her previous book, The Book of Qualities so beloved. It is a work to savor and to share.</p><p><b>J. Ruth Gendler</b> is an artist, writer, and teacher. She is the author of <i>The Book of Qualities</i> and the editor of <i>Changing Light: The Eternal Cycle of Night and Day.</i><i>The Book of Qualities,</i> now in its thirty-fifth printing, has been adapted as a two-act theater piece and translated into German, Japanese, and Chinese, as well as being widely excerpted in literary, psychological and educational publications.

Ruth Gendler's eye and heart are true and the vividness, constancy, and meticulousness of her meditation calls us to the banquet of beauty like music heard across a meadow. This is an utterly nurturing book, savory with loveliness from the exquisite cover art to the last morsel of wisdom." -- <i>Tim Farrington, author of <i>The Monk Downstairs</i> and <i>Lizzie's War</i></i><br><br>"Beauty is as beauty does and Ruth Gendler outdoes herself with this completely charming illustrated compilation of information and inspiration. <i>Notes on the Need for Beauty</i> is warm, winsome and very, very wise." -- <i>Donna Henes, author of <i>The Queen of My Self</i></i><br><br>"Gendler doesn't just teach people how to reach into their creativity--she exudes it." -- <i>Catherine Girardeau, independent radio producer</i><br><br>"In this time when we are losing our own senses by one percent per year, rediscovering the sense for beauty is an urgent priority that requires conscious employment. In <i>Notes on the Need for Beauty</i>, Ruth Gendler presents us with faceted seeds that can be planted in our own souls for rumination. She urges us to look at everything as aesthetic events, to not just look, but to look as if with our arms open. This book is a lighthouse of a gift for individual reimaginations for beauty wherever we uncover it." -- <i>Paulus Berensohn, author of <i>Finding Your Way With Clay</i></i><br><br>"Like a rose disciple, Ruth Gendler takes note of what's beautiful and assembles this wholly original text, full of children talking, mystical insight, the history of cosmetics, sublime etymologies, and big mirrors that someone attached to the sides of the NYC sanitation trucks.

From now on, you do know him and have seen him.&#x201d; (John 14:7)Jesus is the great stumbling block of faith. It is in him that Christianity finds its uniqueness among the religions of the world. He is the Incarnate Son of God, the unique revelation of the Father. Yet so often, we begin the process of theological formulation not with the person of Jesus, but rather, with philosophical arguments about God&#x2019;s existence and logical constructions to determine God&#x2019;s nature.How would our understanding be affected if we instead took Jesus as our starting point for doing theology? In Let&#x2019;s Start with Jesus, respected biblical scholar Dennis Kinlaw explores this question, revealing answers that are profound. In seeking to describe the nature of the relationship God desires with us, he explores three metaphors&#x2015;royal/legal, familial, and nuptial&#x2015;which serve as motifs for his reflection. Taking familiar theological categories, Kinlaw views them through the primary lens of the person and work of Jesus, and finds that Jesus reveals rich pictures of the nature of God, the nature of personhood, the problem of sin, the way of salvation, and finally, the means of sanctification via perfect love. The distilled wisdom of one of this generation&#x2019;s greatest thinkers. Dr. Kinlaw leads you deep into the inner sanctuary of the Holy Trinity and shows you three distinct persons relating to each other in pure reciprocal love.&#x2015;Robert E. Coleman, Distinguished Professor of Evangelism and Discipleship, Gordon-Conwell Theological SeminaryEvery time I read something written by Dennis Kinlaw my mind is stimulated and my heart strangely warmed. Let&#x2019;s Start with Jesus is another important book from a truly gifted man.&#x2015;Lyle W. Dorsett, Billy Graham Professor of Evangelism, Beeson Divinity School, Samford UniversityKinlaw&#x2019;s revolutionary approach to doing theology is much more than that&#x2015;it&#x2019;s a revolutionary approach to life. Kinlaw locates ultimate purpose in a place the church has almost totally neglected, and he does so graciously, with powerful, tightly reasoned biblical argumentation.</p><p>Dr. Dennis F. Kinlaw (PhD Brandeis) is the founder of the Francis Asbury Society in Wilmore, Kentucky and former president of Asbury College.

They reside in Wilmore, Kentucky.Let&#39;s Start with Jesus A NEW CONCEPT OF GOD Ayoung chaplain at one of the colleges of Oxford University made it his practice every year to interview each new student in his college. He wanted to get to know each one and to explain something of the religious program in that college. On occasion, after the chaplain had made his case for the program, a freshman would explain a bit awkwardly that he did not believe in God and probably would not be active in the chaplain&#39;s program. The chaplain would then reply, &#39;How interesting! And in which god do you not believe?&#39; The student then would try to explain his atheism. The chaplain would smile and comment on the fact that he and the student had a great deal in common, for he did not believe in the existence of that god either. Scholars have called Homo sapiens the religious creature. Wherever we find human beings, we find religious acts and religious language. God talk and human beings seem to go together. When a person speaks of God or of gods, what does he or she really mean? The common occurrence of the divine word in human language would seem to suggest that there is universal agreement as to its definition. However, the reality is quite the contrary. Most of the gods that so-called unbelievers reject have never had any objective reality and are simply the goblin constructions of their own minds. The concept in their heads and the reality behind all things may have little relation to each other. The god before whom the sincere believer bows likewise may be a caricature that does little justice to the reality one believes oneself to be worshiping. The consequences for the believer whose mental understanding of God is skewed may not be as serious as would be the atheism of the person who denies God&#39;s very existence, but it is still damaging. Error for the believer, as well as for the unbeliever, always carries its unfortunate consequences. William Temple, former Archbishop of Canterbury, insisted that if our concept of God is wrong, the more religious we get the more dangerous we are to ourselves and others. Our concept of God must be a true representation of the One Who Is, the God with whom all of us ultimately will have to deal. In fact, nothing is more important for anyone or for any society. TWO KINDS OF GOD: POLY/PANTHEISTIC AND MONOTHEISTIC But how can we know what God is really like? Yehezkel Kaufmann is helpful here.1 In his signal work on the religion of Israel, he insists that all of the religions of the world can be put into two categories. The first category includes all of those that are basically naturalistic and express themselves either in pantheism or polytheism. These religions see all things as an unbroken whole and the divine as part of that whole, or else they see the divine as a name for that whole in which we all participate. Some of these religions speak of the divine as that which permeates the whole and in which we all participate. This is pantheism as seen in Hinduism and contemporary New Age thought. The other group in this category sees nature as containing the divine. The divine manifests itself in multiple forces, each of which has its own particular individuality and should be worshiped for itself. Thus, the Greeks could speak of Ouranos (the heavens), Gaia (the earth), Oceanos (the oceans), and Chronos (time) just as the Romans considered Sol (the sun) and Luna (the moon) primordial divine beings. The cultures of the ancient Mediterranean world had the same basic pantheon but used different names. Thus, the Greeks would speak of Aphrodite and the Romans of Venus, but both were speaking of the same factor in human life. We draw our word aphrodisiac from the name of Aphrodite. In speaking about Aphrodite and Venus, the Greeks and the Romans were referring to the erotic force that attracts the male to the female and the female to the male. Such natural forces were ascribed personhood and were worshiped as individual gods. We have known this polytheism classically in the religions of the ancient Near East and the Mediterranean world of Greece, Rome, and Egypt. Some version of it is found among most of the so-called primitive peoples of the earth. Today it is emerging in our postmodern world as New Age thought and practice. Kaufmann&#39;s second group, the monotheistic religions, contains three distinct expressions, each of which is rooted not in nature (as are polytheism and pantheism) but in history. They are Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. One immediately recognizes that these are the three historic religions related to Israel and the Hebrew-Christian Bible. All three go back to Abraham and to his world for their roots. These three religions see nature not as divine but rather as a created expression of a supreme God who transcends that nature. God is not a part of nature and must not be confused with anything within it. For these three religions, to mix nature and the divine is to be guilty of idolatry, the worship of that which has no existence in and of itself but is the product of one beyond itself, from which it comes and on which its very existence depends. In other words, these monotheistic religions all make an ontological distinction between the Creator and the creation. The accuracy of Kaufmann&#39;s analysis is beyond debate. This means that we are indebted to him for simplifying our problem, especially if we feel the need for a God who can actually make a significant difference in the human estate, a God who can help us. Polytheism and pantheism ultimately have no answer to the problem of evil because both see evil as part of the divine world and of the human world. For them what we speak of as &#39;evil&#39; and &#39;divine&#39; are not separable, for the evil of the world is included in the divine. There is nothing but &#39;us.&#39; There is no &#39;beyond&#39; that is ontologically and morally different from us on which we can call or to which we can look for help. Therefore, history, like nature, is seen as repetitive, and the future cannot be essentially different from the past since there is no transcendent, transhistorical personal reality that makes a difference. On the other hand, the concepts of the possibility of a new world, a new society, and a different kind of human person have come into our culture from the Hebrew-Christian Scriptures because of the nature of the biblical God. Kaufmann has helped us take the first step, but the second is equally important. There is one transcendent God, but what is that God&#39;s nature? A close reading of the literature of the three monotheistic religions will show radical differences among these three religious expressions and nowhere more than in their representations of the divine.</p><h2>One Last Scream</h2><p><b>New York Times Bestseller</b><br><br><b>When You're Caught In A Killer's Web. . .</b><br><br> Twelve women have vanished, leaving behind no trace or clue--their whereabouts still a mystery after eleven years. . . <br><br> <b>The Only Thing That Can Save You Is. . .</b><br><br> Amelia Faraday is beautiful, smart, and a walking disaster.

Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois was among the first generation of African-American scholars to spearhead this movement towards equality. As cofounder of the NAACP, he sought to initiate equality through social change, and as a talented writer, he created books and essays that provide a revealing glimpse into the black experience of the times.</p> <p>In <i><strong>The Gift of Black Folk</strong>, </i>Du Bois recounts the history of African Americans and their many unsung contributions to American society. He chronicles their role in the early exploration of America, their part in developing the country&#x2019;s agricultural industry, their courage on the battlefields, and their creative genius in virtually every aspect of American culture. He also highlights the contributions of black women, proposing that their freedom could lead to freedom for all women.</p> <p><strong><em>The Gift of Black Folk </em></strong>provides a powerful picture of the many struggles that paved the way for freedom and equality in our nation.</p></p><p><p><em><strong>William Edward Burghardt Du Boi</strong></em>s, a gifted writer, scholar, sociologist, historian, and activist, became the first African-American to receive a PhD from Harvard University in 1895. An exponent of full equality for African- Americans, Du Bois was a cofounder of the Niagara Movement, which became the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. A leading voice of the black community, Dr. Du Bois&#x2019; teachings, writings, and lectures provided a platform for his views that prompted action and change. Until his death in 1963, W.E.B. Du Bois led a passionate life of ceaseless energy and purposeful writing.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>Once in a great while a book comes out that truly changes the way people look at an important issue.&nbsp; Such was the case in 1924 with the publication of W.E.B. DuBois&#x2019; book <i><strong>The Gift of Black Folk: The Negroes in the Making of America</strong>.</i></p> <p><i></i>In its review of the book in August 1924, the <i>Oakland Tribune </i>declared: &#x201c;The book is one of the most valuable contributions to American literature published in a decade, the result of which should create a better understanding among the races. It proves that Negroes (sic) have the right to be considered and treated as American citizens.&#x201d;</p> <p>Today, more than four decades after the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964 &#x2013; with African Americans having served on the Supreme Court for decades, as Secretary of State for nearly a decade, and now as President of the United States &#x2013; the statement made by the <i>Oakland Tribune </i>seems more than obvious. However, four decades before the Civil Rights Act, in 1924, the fact that African Americans were full citizens and should be considered as such would have seemed revolutionary to many Americans. Jim Crow laws littered the books in many states, segregated schools were often the norm, and American students and readers were often led by the revisionist historians of the day to believe that white Protestant men were the only heroes in American history. Catholic, Jewish, and especially African Americans had no place on the historical timeline popular in the early 20th century.</p> <p>Both despite &#x2013; and because of &#x2013; such widespread bigotry, one organization took up the cause of racial and religious minorities in the United States, seeking to add to the historical record of this country the important pieces that had been previously neglected. That organization was the Knights of Columbus.</p> <p>As Catholics, the Knights of Columbus knew first-hand about prejudice and discrimination. The Knights were founded in Connecticut in 1882 at a time when Catholics had only recently gained the right to vote in that state, and when those who practiced the Catholic faith routinely faced discrimination, especially in employment. Things hadn&#x2019;t improved much by the 1920s. A resurgent Ku Klux Klan targeted &#x2013; in addition to African Americans &#x2013; Jews and Catholics. At the Klan&#x2019;s instigation, Oregon passed a law, targeted at Catholics, which outlawed private religious schools. With the financial support of the Knights, the law was ultimately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it was struck down. The year <i><strong>The Gift of Black Folk</strong> </i>was published was also the year that Al Smith, a Catholic, and a member of the Knights of Columbus, first ran for the presidency. When nominated as the Democratic party&#x2019;s candidate for president four years later, in 1928, Smith would face the hatred and the fiery crosses of the Klan as his train travelled to campaign stops in Oklahoma.</p> <p>It is small wonder that Catholics felt a common cause with those religious and ethnic minorities that were hated even more than Catholics themselves. In 1921, in the face of widespread bigotry, the Knights of Columbus adopted a resolution at its annual convention establishing a &#x201c;Historical Commission,&#x201d; which would seek to counter the revisionist history so widespread at the time, and to add to the historical record, the individual and collective achievements of members of minority groups. Overseeing the project was Edward McSweeney, who had served as assistant U.S. Commissioner of Immigration at Ellis Island from 1893 to 1902.</p> <p>In all, three books would be published by the Historical Commission. In addition to <strong><i>The Gift of Black Folk</i></strong>, the Knights&#x2019; Historical Commission would also publish <i>The Jews in the Making of America, </i>by George Cohen, and <i>The Germans in the Making of America </i>by Dr. Frederick Schrader. In addition to anti-black racism, both anti-Semitism, and, with World War I and its aftermath, anti-German sentiment were serious issues in the United States at that time.</p> <p>Even in 1924, taking a broad and visionary view on racial issues was not something new for the Knights of Columbus. <i>The History of Knights of Columbus, </i>written by William O&#x2019;Neill and published in 1897, tells the story of the creation of Philip Sheridan Council 119 of Southboro, Mass. Before joining the Knights and forming a council, the men of Southboro had been constituted as the John Boyle O&#x2019;Reilly literary society, and had elected and African American man as its president. O&#x2019;Neill pointed this out and wrote that the men of Southboro were &#x201c;in this act reflecting the principles of the Catholic church (sic), which recognizes all colors and races as the children of God.&#x201d;</p> <p>Then, during World War I, the Knights ran the &#x201c;Army Hut&#x201d; program, a forerunner of the USO (United Service Organizations). Knights administered centers that provided for the care and comfort of the troops on military bases in the United States and in France.</p> <p>After the war, a book was published in 1919 that had special praise for the manner in which the Knights of Columbus handled racial issues. <i>The American Negro in the Great War </i>was authored by Emmet J. Scott, an African American who also served as special adjutant to the U.S. Secretary of War. Of the contribution of the Knights, he wrote: &#x201c;Another organization was of much service in making Negro soldiers comfortable at the front. This was the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic society, which has to its credit that, unlike the other social welfare organizations operating in the war, it never drew the color line.&#x201d;</p> <p>So it was that in 1924, it was only natural for the Knights of Columbus to take up the cause of bringing to light the long-neglected record of achievement of African Americans. To write this book, the Knights&#x2019; Historical Commission sought out the most pre-eminent African American scholar of the day, the first black man to have received a Ph.D. from Harvard, W.E.B. DuBois. DuBois was passionate both about civil rights and about &#x201c;Black History.&#x201d; Martin Luther King, Jr. would later say of DuBois: &#x201c;His singular greatness lay in his quest for truth about his own people.&#x201d;</p> <p>What DuBois produced in <strong><i>The Gift of Black Folk</i></strong> was a book that provided an extensive chronicle of African American achievements and contributions to United States. The book helped set the stage for the many books on African American history that would follow.</p> <p>Today, DuBois&#x2019; book continues to have significant value and relevance. Though great progress has been made in the area of racial understanding, there continues to be ignorance of African American history. Sadly, too many Americans still believe that &#x201c;Black History&#x201d; consists of slavery, sharecropping, Jim Crow laws, the civil rights movement, and finally increasing acceptance and achievement at every level of society and government in the United States. What that sort of understanding misses, is exactly what DuBois filled in. From the earliest colonial times forward, DuBois recounts the stories of African American individuals and groups, who concretely contributed to the development of the United States.</p> <p>There are several achievements in the history of the Knights of Columbus &#x2013; an organization I have led since 2000 &#x2013; that give me and our 1.75 million members a justifiable pride in our past. This book, and the Knights ability &#x2013; decades before the civil rights movement &#x2013; to see beyond the racist stereotypes, the hatred and the fear of African Americans, book is one of these gems in our history.</p> <p>Now, 85 years after this book was first published, and 100 years after DuBois and several others founded the NAACP, the republication of this book presents us with an opportunity to look back in order to look forward better. Only in understanding the great achievements of African Americans, in the face of overwhelming obstacles, can we understand how far we have come as a nation, living at a time when an American of any color or race can aspire to any position in our great nation. &nbsp;This book, as an achievement of its own in the furthering of racial understanding and as a compilation of the achievements of an entire race of people, is a classic that will continue to provide readers with a more complete picture of American history, and the contributions to that history, at every stage, by African Americans.</p></p><h2>The Numbers Game: Baseball&#39;s Lifelong Fascination with Statistics</h2><p><p>Most baseball fans, players and even team executives assume that the national pastime's infatuation with statistics is simply a by-product of the information age, a phenomenon that blossomed only after the arrival of Bill James and computers in the 1980s. They couldn't be more wrong.</p><p>In this award-winning book, Alan Schwarz - whom bestselling<i> Moneyball </i>author Michael Lewis calls "one of today's best baseball journalists" - provides the first-ever history of baseball statistics, showing how baseball and its numbers have been inseparable ever since the pastime's birth in 1845. He tells the history of this obsession through the lives of the people who felt it most: Henry Chadwick, the 19th-century writer who invented the first box score and harped endlessly about which statistics mattered and which did not; Allan Roth, Branch Rickey's right-hand numbers man with the late-1940s Brooklyn Dodgers; Earnshaw Cook, a scientist and Manhattan Project veteran who retired to pursue inventing the perfect baseball statistic; John Dewan, a former Strat-O-Matic maven who built STATS Inc. into a multimillion-dollar powerhouse for statistics over the Internet; and dozens more.</p><p>Schwarz paints a history not just of baseball statistics, but of the soul of the sport itself.

She argued that a rejection of psychoanalysis as bourgeois and patriarchal was fatal for feminism. However it may have been used, she pointed out, psychoanalysis is not a recommendation <i>for</i> a patriarchal society, but rather an analysis <i>of</i> one. "If we are interested in understanding and challenging the oppression of women," she says, "we cannot afford to neglect psychoanalysis." In an introduction written specially for this reissue, Mitchell reflects on the changing relationship between these two major influences on twentieth-century thought. Original and provocative, <i>Psychoanalysis and Feminism</i> remains an essential component of the feminist canon.</p><p><b>Juliet Mitchell</b>, the author of <i>Psychoanalysis and Feminism</i>, is currently a visiting professor in Comparative Literature at Yale University, where she is also a Fellow of the Whitney Humanities Center. She is a university lecturer in Gender and Society at Cambridge University and a Fellow of Jesus College. She lives in London and Cambridge."Juliet Mitchell has risked accusations of apostasy from her fellow feminists.

Situated in the oil-soaked chaos of Spindletop, Jefferson County was a hotbed of vice. For decades, gambling and prostitution thrived as elected officials either looked the other way or took money to keep quiet. That is, until 1960 when a swashbuckling young state legislator blew into town and spearheaded an intensive investigation into the rampant vice and governmental corruption that supported it. And, at a time when such things were virtually unheard of, he and his committee played it out on live television. When the dust finally cleared, the local governments of Jefferson County were turned inside out.</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Poetical Works of James Whitcomb Riley</h2><p><p>Few lives have left so vivid an impression upon a native environment as that of James Whitcomb Riley, the Hoosier Poet. His folksy, down-home rhymes are still enormously popular in his native state and beyond. This publication brings back into print the complete Riley repertoire of more than 1,000 poems, including such all-time favorites as "Little Orphant Annie" (far and away the best-loved of all Riley characters), "The Raggedy Man," "Our Hired Girl," "A Barefoot Boy," "The Bumblebee," "Granny," and "When the Frost Is on the Punkin."<br> It is said that Indiana&#x2019;s best-known poet did not portray but invented the typical Hoosier. Applying imaginative skill, Riley altered and adapted the people around him to suit his purpose. As Jeannette Covert Nolan once put it, the figure who emerged was "a mellow, humorous rustic, a quaint, bucolic philosopher, unlettered but gifted with an earthy shrewdness, a peasant wisdom, a heart of gold, speaking a drawling, hybrid tongue, a dubious dialect as yet unidentified by any philologist."<br> In his heyday Riley was famous all over the world. Though often called a children&#x2019;s poet, he actually wrote about children for adults, delighting in emotional reminders of an irretrievable past&#x2015;perhaps one that never quite existed. Throughout his life Riley looked back wistfully and sentimentally upon his childhood days, turning the longings and unfulfilled dreams of youth into verse. So celebrated was he in Indiana that in many public elementary schools, students were required to memorize and recite one of his poems every week for admiring audiences of visiting parents.</p><p>If I Knew What Poets Know<br>If I knew what poets know, Did I know what poets do, If I knew what poets know,<br> Would I write a rhyme Would I sing a song, I would find a theme<br>Of the buds that never blow Sadder than the pigeon&#x2019;s coo Sweeter than the p</p></p><p>This publication brings back into print the complete Riley repertoire of more than 1000 poems.<p>JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY (1849&#x2013;1916), born at Greenfield, Indiana, became a Hoosier legend even before his death.</p></p><h2>Tao Te Ching: 81 Verses by Lao Tzu with Introduction and Commentary</h2><p>An evocative and poetic translation of this great ancient treasure - illustrated with dramatic black and silver photographs that perfectly capture the beauty and essence of Lao Tsu's spiritual masterpiece.<br><br>'This is an extraordinary book, enlightening and insightful in personal and social realms.

In between "Once upon a time" and "happily ever after" we embark on adventures that seem an eternity away from our everyday lives, and yet through these adventures we are brought back to the innocence and beauty of the truth. In <em>The Mysteries of Children's Literature</em>, journey through a treasury of well-known fables and folk tales, as well as others not so well known, and discover the wisdom hiding within them. In an age that rejects the moral absolutes and repudiates the whole idea of intrinsic evils, children's literature restores the meaning of good and evil, beautiful and ugly, and normal and abnormal.</p> <p>"Fairy tales clear the way for sanctity. They are the child's first morality play, clear-cut, no-nonsense black and white, good and evil, life and death - with a bit of fun thrown in to alleviate the pain." -Ethel Pochocki</p></p><p><p>Dr. Mitchell Kalpakgian (Ph.D., University of Iowa) has taught English literature for fifty years at several colleges.

Often as amusing as the characters they portray, voice actors are charming, resilient people-many from humble beginnings-who have led colorful lives in pursuit of success. <i>Beavis and Butthead</i> and <i>King of the Hill's</i> Mike Judge was an engineer for a weapons contractor turned self-taught animator and voice actor. Nancy Cartwright (the voice of Bart Simpson) was a small town Ohio girl who became the star prot�g� of Daws Butler-most famous for Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, and Quick Draw McGraw. Mickey Mouse (Wayne Allwine) and Minnie Mouse (Russi Taylor) are a real-life husband-and-wife team. Spanning many studios and production companies, this book captures the spirit of fun that bubbles from those who create the voices of favorite animated characters. </p><p> In the earliest days of cartoons, voice actors were seldom credited for their work. A little more than a decade ago, even the Screen Actors Guild did not consider voice actors to be real actors, and the only voice actor known to the general public was Mel Blanc. Now, Oscar-winning celebrities clamor to guest star on animated television shows and features. </p><p> Despite the crushing turnouts at signings for shows such as <i>Animaniacs</i>, <i>The Simpsons</i>, and <i>SpongeBob Squarepants</i>, most voice actors continue to work in relative anonymity. <i>The Magic Behind the Voices</i> features personal interviews and concise biographical details, parting the curtain to reveal creators of many of the most beloved cartoon voices.</p></p><p><p>Stories of the actors who gave voice to SpongeBob SquarePants, Beavis and Butthead, Bart and Homer Simpson, Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, and many more animated characters</p>A biographical encyclopedia of the actors who gave voice to SpongeBob Squarepants, Beavis and Butthead, Bart and Homer Simpson, Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, and many, many more <p>Boasts an impressive who's who lineup of voice actors for Yogi Bear, Scooby Doo, the Jetsons, Snow White, Popeye, Betty Boop, Pinkeye, the Brain, Underdog, and more </p><p>Features detailed information on 39 voice actors </p><p>Features photographs of the voice actors and comprehensive lists of each actor's performance credits </p><p>Delivers the zany and fun spirit of these special actors who, until recently, weren't acknowledged</p></p><h2>Mandolin Chord Dictionary: Handy Guide (Alfred Handy Guide)</h2><p>Learning chords for the mandolin have never been so easy.

How do they see themselves and the world around them? Here B.R. Myers, a North Korea analyst and a contributing editor of The Atlantic, presents the first full-length study of the North Korean worldview. Drawing on extensive research into the regime&#x2019;s domestic propaganda, including films, romance novels and other artifacts of the personality cult, Myers analyzes each of the country&#x2019;s official myths in turn from the notion of Koreans&#x2019; unique moral purity, to the myth of an America quaking in terror of ";the Iron General."; In a concise but groundbreaking historical section, Myers also traces the origins of this official culture back to the Japanese fascist thought in which North Korea&#x2019;s first ideologues were</p><p><b>B.R.

According to traditional Chinese medicine, chi is the fuel and essence that connects body, mind, and spirit, and without it we fall apart physically, mentally, and spiritually. Master Liao explains why protecting our chi is so important, how it gets taxed and damaged in our lives, and&#x2014;most importantly&#x2014;how to restore it. He demonstrates exercises and meditations to be done on a daily basis that are easy-to-learn, low-impact, and suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels. <br><br>The healthful benefits of the practices are now recognized in mainstream medical circles where t&#x2019;ai chi and chi gung classes are increasingly offered as complementary medicine. Master Waysun Liao&#x2019;s selected exercises provide the essentials for a restorative, revitalizing practice.</p><p>Master Waysun Liao studied t&#x2019;ai chi in a Taoist temple in his native Taiwan from the age of twelve. He is the founder and master of the Taichi Tao Center in Oak Park, Illinois, where he has taught for nearly forty years.<b> 1</b><br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>CHI</b><br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&nbsp;Integral to Health and Peace of Mind</i><br> &nbsp;<br> TO SEE THE MIRACLE of life energy, all we have to do is consider a seed. It&#x2019;s so small, so shriveled and dry. It&#x2019;s hard to believe that such a small thing can explode into something as large and full of life as a tree.<br> A seed and a tree look so different from each other. Unless somebody taught you the basics of botany or biology, you wouldn&#x2019;t even know that the two have any possible relationship to one another, much less that they are in some sense the same thing.<br> The seed and the tree are simultaneously completely different and completely connected. The miracle bridging the two is a mysterious and invisible force&#x2014;the life energy deep inside the seed. It&#x2019;s that miracle of intelligent force, that constructive blueprint, that power that explodes into the first green shoot after a spring rain, that quiet wisdom that governs the entire process of a seed growing into a tree that later produces more seeds. We cannot see it, we cannot hear it, we cannot taste or smell it. We can only observe its monumental effects by the evidence of the towering tree standing in front of us.<br> The life energy of the seed is the same life that creates the leaves, the sap, the fruit, the bark, and the wood of the tree. It is the same life energy that tells the tree when to grow new buds and when to drop its leaves and go dormant for the winter. It gives the tree its &#x201c;consciousness&#x201d; in its own world of sun, water, wind, and soil. Everything in, on, and about that tree depends on and is linked together by that same invisible life energy. And absolutely all of that tree&#x2019;s power and potential was inherent in that original, dry, dead-looking seed.<br> Did you know you have a lot in common with the seed and the tree? You, too, sprang from a tiny seed&#x2014;the seed we call the first single cell. From that microscopic beginning, over a long and miraculous journey, that single cell made the astounding transformation into an embryo, a fetus, and then a newborn. Since your birth, the original energy from your first single cell continues to explode into the full-grown human being you are today, with all your talents, strengths, and capabilities. That same energy is what still enlivens and sustains. Just like that journey from a seed to a tree, the journey from that single cell into who you are now is made possible by the original intelligence, power, and blueprint held within your life energy.<br> Your life energy was smart and industrious enough to pull in all the necessary building blocks to create your body. It established the flow of blood through your veins; it created your brain; it enlivens your organs and tells them what to do; it fuels your mind and thought processes; and it produces your consciousness, which enables your spirit to function. Without that energy, your body would fall limp, your brain would cease to function, and your spirit could no longer maintain its connection to your body. This same life energy&#x2014;carried forward from that first single cell&#x2014;creates, sustains, and holds every part of you together: from top to bottom, inside and out.<br> Clearly, if such a small amount of life energy can do so much, it is a precious substance. If such energy is what builds, maintains, and fuels the mind, body, and spirit, it is clear that we must protect and cherish it.<br> But the sad fact is that from the moment we emerge from the womb, our life energy&#x2014;chi&#x2014;starts to weaken, becoming vulnerable to contamination and distortion. That&#x2019;s why we age, suffer, experience illness, and eventually die. Our chi loses its integrity.<br> As newborns we are like brand-new cars with zero miles. As infants and young children, our bodies run smoothly, and our chi is able to repair itself and any injuries seamlessly and quickly. But as we age, we rack up more and more miles. Pretty soon breakdowns are inevitable. We lose our original integrity of function, just like old cars. If only we could turn back the odometer and restore the pristine purity of that newborn chi.<br> We can, but it takes work. In today&#x2019;s society, few people are even aware that they have something called chi, or life energy. They take it for granted and don&#x2019;t consider that this special part of themselves is worth learning about, strengthening, and protecting.<br> Modern life has us chasing many outward goals: happiness, riches, fame, success, security, career satisfaction, friends, family, entertainment, and so on. We rarely take the time to stop, look inward, and take stock of the condition of our chi. Like old cars, we keep on driving and take it for granted until something breaks down. Only then do we wish we&#x2019;d paid more attention to maintenance.<br> Understandably, we want all the joys that life can give us, so we keep trying for more. We work, strive, chase, and study to achieve goals that will give us more money, more enjoyment, more prestige, more friends&#x2014;more, more, more. Who has time to stop and look within? To stop and meditate or repair or even remember that we have something as vague and subtle as life energy?<br> It&#x2019;s as if everyone wants to live like a millionaire. Let&#x2019;s consider what that means. A person with lots of success, many friends, and a wealth of riches increases his sense of worth in our world. We&#x2019;ll represent him with the number 1,000,000. As he accumulates more wealth, more family, more friends, more power, and more prestige, it&#x2019;s as if he keeps adding more and more zeroes to the increasing sum of his life worth. He may even become 1,000,000,000. A person with more modest life achievements might only be seen as 1,000. Who wants to be just 1,000 or 100? Give us more zeroes!<br> The problem is that we keep wanting to add more good things, chasing more and more zeroes, to increase our sense of worth, but we never stop to consider the condition of our number one. Our life energy is like the number one to all of those zeroes. What happens to the number 1,000 or 1,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 if you take away the one at the beginning? They each become nothing. While we may feel like millionaires, if we don&#x2019;t keep and protect that number one, we risk being left with only a string of zeroes.<br> Instead of chasing more zeroes to add to your life sum, it is wiser to look after and protect your one. After all, Lao Tzu asks in the Tao Te Ching, &#x201c;What is more important, your wealth or your life?&#x201d;<br> He also urges those who seek the Tao to &#x201c;embrace the One.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s not referring to embracing merely our own life energy. He&#x2019;s actually saying to embrace the One Power of Tao. But to embrace the Tao, you have to start by being able to embrace your own life energy, to put it first in your life. How can you hope to embrace the Tao if you cannot find, feel, protect, and embrace your own chi, the piece of Tao inside you?<br> If you go back and read the U.S. Declaration of Independence, you&#x2019;ll find the hallmark statement that all people &#x201c;are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#x201d; The founding fathers showed a lot of wisdom. Life must come first, for without it, how can we enjoy liberty? Without life, the pursuit of happiness is meaningless. To protect liberty, happiness, and anything else we value, we must first protect life. And that means protecting and preserving the integrity of our life energy.<br> Today, we&#x2019;ve lost sight of our real priorities. You can go to many time management seminars or even buy special life-planning notebooks that help you set your priorities and get the most out of your day. But if you were to sneak a peak at most people&#x2019;s daily list of priorities and life goals, it&#x2019;s probable that almost none would include protecting and strengthening their chi.<br> Whoever you are, whatever you are doing right now, let&#x2019;s erase everything else for just a little while and put life energy at the top of your priority list. Let&#x2019;s invest a little time to learn more about this invisible but powerful force inside. Let&#x2019;s discover a way to nourish and preserve it. After all, it&#x2019;s the most precious treasure we possess. If you agree, it&#x2019;s time we unwrap that treasure and take a look.</p><h2>Ready, Steady, Go!: The Smashing Rise and Giddy Fall of Swinging London</h2><p><b>It&#x2019;s the summer of 1966... </b>The fundamental old ways: chastity, rationality, harmony, sobriety, even democracy: blasted to nothing or crumbling under siege. The city glows. It echoes. It pulses. It bleeds pastel and fuzzy, spicy, paisley and soft. This is how it's always going to be: smashing clothes, brilliant music, easy sex, eternal youth, the eyes of everybody, everyone's first thought, the top of the world, right here, right now: <i>Swinging London.</i><br><br>Shawn Levy has a genius for unearthing the secret history of popular culture. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> called <i>King of Comedy</i>, his biography of Jerry Lewis, "a model of what a celebrity bio ought to be&#x2013;smart, knowing, insightful, often funny, full of fascinating insiders' stories," and the<i> Boston Globe</i> declared that <i>Rat Pack Confidential</i> "evokes the time in question with the power of a novel, as well as James Ellroy's <i>American Tabloid</i> and better by far than Don DeLillo's <i>Underworld.</i>"<br><br>In <i>Ready, Steady, Go! </i>Levy captures the spirit of the sixties in all its exuberance. A portrait of London from roughly 1961 to 1969, it chronicles the explosion of creativity&#x2013;in art, music and fashion&#x2013;and the revolutions&#x2013;sexual, social and political&#x2013;that reshaped the world. Levy deftly blends the enthusiasm of a fan, the discerning eye of a social critic and a historian's objectivity as he re-creates the hectic pace and daring experimentation of the times&#x2013;from the utter transformation of rock 'n' roll by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to the new aesthetics introduced by fashion designers like Mary Quant, haircutters like Vidal Sassoon, photographers like David Bailey, actors like Michael Caine and Terence Stamp and filmmakers like Richard Lester and Nicolas Roeg to the wild clothing shops and cutting-edge clubs that made Carnaby Street and King's Road the hippest thoroughfares in the world. <br><br>Spiced with the reminiscences of some of the leading icons of that period, their fans and followers, and featuring a photographic gallery of well-known faces and far-out fashions, <i>Ready, Steady, Go! </i>is an irresistible re-creation of a time and place that seemed almost impossibly fun.</p><p>SHAWN LEVY is the author of six previous books, including the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>bestsellers&nbsp;<i>Rat Pack Confidential</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Paul Newman: A Life</i>.&nbsp; He served as film critic of&nbsp;<i>The Oregonian</i>&nbsp;from 1997 to 2012 and is a former senior editor of<i>American Film</i>&nbsp;and a former associate editor of&nbsp;<i>Box Office</i>. His work has appeared in the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>, the&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Guardian</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Independent, Film Comment, Movieline,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Sight and Sound</i>, among many other publications. He lives in Portland, Oregon.A Cloud of Pink Chiffon<br><br>The story of David Bailey's early life and career would come to sound a cliche: Scruffy East End (or maybe northern) boy aspires to a field normally reserved for the posh and sets the world on its ear without bending his personality to fit the long-established model. But like the jokes in Shakespeare or the Marx Brothers, it was only familiar because it was repeated so often from the original. All the pop stars, actors, dressmakers, haircutters, club owners, scenesters, satirists and boy tycoons who exploded on the London scene in the early sixties did so after Bailey, often in his mold and almost always in front of his camera.<br><br>Before mod and the Beat Boom, before Carnaby Street and the swinging hot spots of Soho and Chelsea, before, indeed, sex and drugs and most of rock 'n' roll there were the laddish young photographers from the East: Bailey, Brian Duffy and Terence Donovan, "the Terrible Three" in the affectionate phrase of Cecil Beaton, an iconoclastic snapper of another age whose approval of the new lot made it that much easier for them to barge in on what had been a very exclusive and sedate party.<br><br>The trio--and a few others who came along in the rush--dressed and spoke and carried on as no important photographers ever had, not even in the putatively wide-open worlds of fashion magazines and photojournalism. They spoke like smart alecks and ruffians, they flaunted their high salaries and the Rolls-Royces they flashed around in, they slept with the beautiful women who modeled for them, they employed new cameras and technologies to break fertile ground in portraiture and fashion shoots. They were superstars from a world that had previously been invisible, perhaps with reason. "Before 1960," Duffy famously said, "a fashion photographer was somebody tall, thin and camp. But we three are different: short, fat and heterosexual."<br><br>Duffy could enjoy such self-deprecating boasts because, recalled Dick Fontaine, who tried to make a documentary about the trio, "He was really the kind of architect of the guerilla warfare on those who control the fashion industry and the press."<br><br>But it was Bailey who would bring the group their fame and glory. Bailey was the first bright shiny star of the sixties, a subject of jealous gossip, an inspiration in fashion, speech and behavior, an exemplar of getting ahead in a glamorous world, and, incidentally, the great, lasting chronicler of his day.<br><br>Bailey was born January 2, 1938, in Leytonstone, east of the East End, a block over, he always liked to brag, from the street where Alfred Hitchcock was born. When Bailey was three, the family home took a hit from a Nazi bomb and they relocated to Heigham Road, East Ham, which was where Bailey and his younger sister, Thelma, were raised.<br><br>Their father, Herbert, was a tailor's cutter and a flash character who dressed nattily, ran around on his wife and like to have a roll of fivers at hand; his wife, Gladys, kept house but also worked as a machinist, especially after Bert finally split on her. The family wasn't rich, but they were comfortable--they were among the first people in the block to have a telephone and TV set, and Bailey was made to dress smartly, to his chagrin ("What chance have you got in a punch-up in East Ham wearing sandals?" he later sighed). But they weren't entirely free of money worries, and one of their ways of dealing with them was, to Bailey, a blessing: "In the winter," he recalled, the family "would take bread-and-jam sandwiches and go to the cinema every night because in those days it was cheaper to go to the cinema than to put on the gas fire. I'll bet I saw seven or eight movies a week."<br><br>Bailey fell, predictably enough, under the spell of rugged (and mainly American) actors at around the same time that his parents' marriage was foundering. But Bert Bailey was nonetheless a little worried about his son's fancy for birdwatching and natural history, which loves led the boy into vegetarianism. "My father thought I was fucking queer," Bailey said, "but queer didn't mean homosexual. In those days it just meant a bit of an oddball."<br><br>Part of Bailey's queerness was taking and developing photos of birds--he preferred the latter process, as it involved playing with chemicals. But he didn't think of taking pictures as a career ambition--"photography was something you did once a year on Margate beach"--and he had enough on his hands at school, where his learning disabilities (undiagnosed at the time) made for a hellish routine. "I can't read and write," Bailey said. "Dysgraphia, dyslexia--I've got them all. I went to the silly class--the school for idiots--and they used to cane me when I couldn't spell. It was quite tough knowing that you're smart and thinking you're an idiot."<br><br>At fifteen, he dropped out of school altogether and started a series of unpromising jobs: copy boy at the Fleet Street offices of the Yorkshire Post, carpet salesman, shoe salesman, window dresser, time-and-motion man at the tailoring firm where his dad worked and debt collector. He developed a taste for jazz and spent nights checking out the music and women at the handful of venues the East End offered someone his age. His musical interests were underscored in his oft-quoted quip about his roots: "You had two ways of getting out in the fifties--you were either a boxer or a jazz musician." So perhaps it was inevitable that he followed an artistic muse, especially as he quickly learned how ill-suited he was to make a living with his fists: "The Krays, the Barking Boys and the Canning Town Boys were the three gangs at the time," Bailey remembered. "They weren't gangsters, they were just hooligans. They just went around beating people up if you looked at them wrong in a dance hall. I got beat up by the Barking Boys because I danced with one of their girlfriends. They left me in the doorway of Times Furnishing."<br><br>Bailey's dreamy aimlessness was finally punctured by the call-up: In the spring of 1956, he was ordered to report for a physical for the National Service. He tried to duck it--he stayed up two nights straight and consumed a huge quantity of nutmeg ("Someone said it made your heart go faster"), but it didn't work. He might have requested assignment to a photographic unit, but that meant a longer hitch than he was ready to sign for. In August, he reported for basic training in the Royal Air Force, and by December he was stationed in Singapore as a first-level aircraftman with duties such as helping to keep planes flight ready and standing guard on funeral drill.<br><br>On the whole, Private Bailey found the situation pleasant enough. "I had a good time in the National Service," he confessed years later. "I hate to sound like a right-wing middle-aged man, but I think it was very good for me." There were, he admitted, drawbacks: "The snobbery! They had a toilet for privates, a toilet for sergeants and a toilet for commissioned officers, as if all our arses were different. It made me angry, the way we were treated, almost like a slave. You were dirt compared with an officer."<br><br>Indeed, it was a run-in with an officer that would prove pivotal in shaping Bailey's future. He was still on his jazz kick--his "Chet Baker phase," as he later deemed it--and trying to teach himself to play the trumpet. But when an officer borrowed his horn and failed to return it, he was forced to seek another creative outlet. Cameras could be gotten cheap in Singapore, so Bailey--who'd been as enamored of the photos of Baker on the trumpeter's album jackets as by the playing inside--bought a knockoff Rolleiflex. He was sufficiently hard up for money that he had to pawn the camera every time he wanted to pay for developing his film, but he caught the bug.<br><br>The camera suited Bailey's growing bohemianism. He had begun to read, and where his barracks mates had pinup girls hung over their beds, he had a reproduction of a Picasso portrait of Dora Maar. His pretensions didn't go unnoticed: "I did used to get into fights," he said. "But because I was from the East End I could look after myself. I also had the best-looking WAAF as my girlfriend, so they knew I wasn't gay."<br><br>When he demobbed in August 1958, Bailey acquired a Canon Rangefinder camera and the ambition to make a living with it. He applied to the London College of Printing but was rejected because he'd dropped out of school. Instead, he wound up working as a second assistant to photographer David Olins at his studio in Charlotte Mews in the West End. He was a glorified gofer--not even glorified, actually, at three pounds, ten shillings a week--and was therefore delighted a few months later to be called to an interview at the studio of John French, a somewhat better-known name and a man who had a reputation for nurturing his assistants' careers.<br><br>French, then in his early fifties, was the epitome of the fashion photographer and portraitist of the era: exquisitely attired, fastidious, posh and gay (although, as it happened, married). "John French looked," Bailey remembered, "like Fred Astaire. 'David,' he said, 'do you know about incandescent light and strobe? Do you know how to load a ten-by-eight film pack?' I said yes to everything he asked and he gave me the job, but, at that time, I didn't even know what a strobe was. We became friends and after six o'clock Mr. French became John. One night I asked him why he gave me the job. 'Well, you know, David,' he said, 'I liked the way you dressed.' Six months later everyone thought we were having an affair, but in fact, although we were fond of each other, we never got it on."<br><br>In fact, French--"a screaming queen who fancied East End boys," according to documentarian Dick Fontaine--was the first person to really recognize something special in Bailey. Partly it was his bohemian style--Cuban-heeled boots, jeans, leather jacket and hair over the ears, all before the Beatles had been heard of; party in was his aptitude for the craft. French liked to compare his young protege to the unnamed hero of Colin MacInnes's cult novel about bohemian London, Absolute Beginners--a savvy insight--and he was perfectly willing, as he had with many previous disciples, to see Bailey get ahead in his own work.<br><br>"He was an incredibly decent type of man," Bailey would say of his mentor after French died in 1966. "I don't think he was very good as a photographer, but he had a good attitude. His photography sort of slowed me down a bit, because I had to break away from his way of doing things, but I benefited from his attitude."<br><br>Even more, he would say years later, "I owe my success to two gay men, really, who told me I was wonderful and pushed me. Being a Cockney and working class, I was an outsider, and in those days gays were outcasts, too. So we felt an affinity. Anyway, John French introduced me to the picture editor of the Daily Express, and John Parsons, the art director of British Vogue--the second gay man--saw my pictures in the newspaper and offered me a job at the magazine."<br><br>It was in the Daily Express, in fact, that Bailey published his first really important photo--an image of the model Paulene Stone wearing a dark knee-length skirt and a bright turtleneck mohair sweater and crouching on the leaf-strewn ground to commune with a squirrel, who was nibbling on an ort. Terence Donovan, who didn't yet know Bailey, was among the people who reacted strongly to the image, pronouncing himself "disturbed by its freshness and its oblique quality." On the strength of that shot and a few other striking pictures, Bailey found himself hired in May 1960, as a full-fledged photographer at John Cole's Studio Five, earning thirty to forty pounds a week.<br><br>The money came in handy, as Bailey had in February of that year married Rosemary Bramble, a typist whom he'd met at Soho's Flamingo Club a few months previous. The couple lived in a small apartment near The Oval cricket ground in South London. Bailey's salary wasn't grand, but it was good, and when John Parsons of Vogue called on Bailey later that year to ask him about joining the staff of the magazine, Bailey refused because he was doing so well with Cole.<br><br>"They were offering me less per week than Woman's Own was paying me per picture," Bailey remembered. "I didn't realize that Vogue was different from any other fashion magazine. . . . I thought it was just another magazine that used pictures. I wasn't that interested in fashion and preferred reportage and portraits, but fashion gradually took over because of Vogue." The next time Parsons asked, though, Bailey agreed. His first small piece appeared in the magazine in September 1960, followed by full-page work the next month and, in February 1961, his first cover. The Bailey legend was about to be made.<br><br>Bailey's arrival at deluxe fashion magazines couldn't have come at a more perfect time to suit his ambitions. The media business, so long a stolid presence in English life, had grown increasingly itchy in the preceding years. English magazine culture was in the throes of an invigorating shake-up that had begun in the least likely of places. The Queen, a hundred year old society magazine, had undergone a radical change at the hands of its new owner/editor, Jocelyn Stevens, who transformed it from a dry lifestyle report for the upper classes and those with a passion for following their lives (Stevens sniffed that the old Queen was all about how to "knit your own royal family") into the most vital publication in the country, with fresh concepts in photography and layout and a wry new attitude toward its putative subject: British tradition.<br><br>Queen began branching out into areas that had never before been within the purview of a society magazine: articles about the Cuban revolution, a four-issue photo essay about Red China by Henri Cartier-Bresson (who was then hired by Stevens to cover the annual Queen Charlotte's debutante ball "like a war") and a series of articles and features that tried to capture the changing mood of Britain. In one, a parody of the Eton College Chronicle (Stevens had attended the school), the establishment of the day, insofar as The Queen saw it, was sent up as a bunch of schoolboys. In 1959, an entire issue was dedicated to the "Boom . . . Boom . . . boom"--the new decorators, dress designers, cars, art treasures and overall lavish living ("When did you last hear the word austerity," the lead article asked, and then went on to chronicle England's rise as a producer of advertising, a consumer of champagne and a piler-up of consumer debt); surveys were published on the New Thinkers (including fashion designer Mary Quant, satirist Jonathan Miller and interior designer Terence Conran), the Challengers (including actor Terence Stamp) and New Faces; charts of Who Revolves Around Who were run. Within three years, the magazine nearly tripled in size to accommodate all the advertising its heat had drawn.</p><h2>Evidence of Being: The Black Gay Cultural Renaissance and the Politics of Violence</h2><p><p><i>Evidence of Being</i> opens on a grim scene: Washington DC&#x2019;s gay black community in the 1980s, ravaged by AIDS, the crack epidemic, and a series of unsolved murders, seemingly abandoned by the government and mainstream culture. Yet in this darkest of moments, a new vision of community and hope managed to emerge. Darius Bost&#x2019;s account of the media, poetry, and performance of this time and place reveals a stunning confluence of activism and the arts. In Washington and New York during the 1980s and &#x2019;90s, gay black men banded together, using creative expression as a tool to challenge the widespread views that marked them as unworthy of grief. They created art that enriched and reimagined their lives in the face of pain and neglect, while at the same time forging a path toward bold new modes of existence. At once a corrective to the predominantly white male accounts of the AIDS crisis and an openhearted depiction of the possibilities of black gay life, <i>Evidence of Being</i> above all insists on the primacy of community over loneliness, and hope over despair.</p></p><p>Darius Bost is assistant professor of ethnic studies in the School for Cultural and Social Transformation at the University of Utah.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Recommended. . .&nbsp;Bost analyzes a renaissance of writing that sparked in these years [1978-1995] a second Harlem Renaissance, although one whose contributors were more openly gay. . . .&nbsp;They wrote to find a way to be, to survive, in the present and the future, if only as literary archive. Bost argues the power of cultural production that sustained &#x201c;black gay men amid the ubiquitous forms of violence that targeted them.&#x201d;&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Evidence of Being</i> critically and brilliantly moves away from claims about the anti-relational and pessimistic natures of blackness and queerness, doing so with historical attentiveness and theoretical sophistication. There is no book that provides a more comprehensive history of black gay male activism and cultural production in the seventies and eighties than this one.&#x201d; (<i>Roderick Ferguson, author of Aberrations in Black</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;Evidence of Being</i> conjures up late twentieth-century African American struggles for recognition in a society that barely noticed the calamity of the AIDS crisis. Bost assembles an impressive array of original writings and revealing documents that illuminate defiant figures negotiating overlapping structures of prejudice. His book is a black gay interpretive turning point: as readable as it is teachable, as original as it is indispensable.&#x201d; (<i>Kevin Mumford, author Not Straight, Not White</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Evidence of Being</i> is both a compelling and informative study and an emotionally moving ritual that beckons present and future black fugitive subjects to remember the importance of the literary arts in surviving and thriving against the perils of anti-black and anti-gay violence, politics, and culture. Bost eloquently answers Melvin Dixon&#x2019;s call to remember &#x2018;with broad vision&#x2019; the empowering force of black gay being and cultural imagination.&#x201d; (<i>L. H. Stallings, author of Funk the Erotic</i>)</p><h2>Castigo Cay</h2><p>Dan Kilmer is a former Marine sniper in his early thirties. He returned home from military service in the Middle East and gave college a try, but his combat experiences prevented him from fitting into campus life. In a South Florida boatyard, his uncle was attempting to refurbish an old cargo schooner, and Dan left college to help him finish the flagging project. After two years of work but before the sixty-foot boat was relaunched, his uncle fell from a scaffold and died. While still in his twenties, Dan inherited the schooner Rebel Yell. Soon after, he left the United States to embark on a series of voyages, mostly in pursuit of beautiful women and good times. While he was away from America, new federal taxes were imposed on luxury property, including privately owned yachts. Dan cannot pay these or other new taxes, so he can t return to the States without risking confiscation of his schooner. Instead he must always fly under official radar and earn a living by his wits while staying one step ahead of the IRS and other government agencies. He must navigate the reefs of government control while always searching for a way to make money without the permission of the local authorities. This usually requires some type of shady dealing, subterfuge, and stealing from thieves as Dan moves from port to port. A shifting cast of crew members inhabits Rebel Yell, but the novel is about Dan Kilmer and his quest to live as a free man in an increasingly unfree world. In Castigo Cay, Dan must sneak back into South Florida under the radar to conduct a short-fuse rescue mission.</p><p>Matthew J.

Among the kidnapped is Nick Rendel, a computer software coding expert in charge of drone programming and strategy. He is the victim with the most dangerous knowledge, including confidential passwords and codes that are used to program the drones. If revealed, his kidnappers could reprogram the drones to strike targets within the United States.<br><br> Jon Smith and the Covert One team begin a worldwide search to recover the officials, but as the first kidnapping victims are rescued, they show disturbing signs of brainwashing or mind-altering drugs.

But Dr. Taylor's research was suspended almost a year ago, when she was placed in a mental institution.

Nancy Abrams, a philosopher of science, lawyer, and lifelong atheist, is among them. And yet, when she turned to the recovery community to face a personal struggle, she found that imagining a higher power gave her a new freedom. Intellectually, this was quite surprising. <br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile her husband, famed astrophysicist Joel Primack, was helping create a new theory of the universe based on dark matter and dark energy, and Abrams was collaborating with him on two books that put the new scientific picture into a social and political context. She wondered, &#x201c;Could anything actually exist in this strange new universe that is worthy of the name &#x2018;God?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>A God That Could Be Real</i>, Abrams explores a radically new way of thinking about God. She dismantles several common assumptions about God and shows why an omniscient, omnipotent God that created the universe and plans what happens is incompatible with science&#x2014;but that this doesn&#x2019;t preclude a God that can comfort and empower us.<br> &nbsp;<br> Moving away from traditional arguments for God, Abrams finds something worthy of the name &#x201c;God&#x201d; in the new science of emergence: just as a complex ant hill emerges from the collective behavior of individually clueless ants, and just as the global economy emerges from the interactions of billions of individuals&#x2019; choices, God, she argues, is an &#x201c;emergent phenomenon&#x201d; that arises from the staggering complexity of humanity&#x2019;s collective aspirations and is in dialogue with every individual. This God did not create the universe&#x2014;it created the meaning of the universe. It&#x2019;s not universal&#x2014;it&#x2019;s planetary. It can&#x2019;t change the world, but it helps <i>us</i> change the world. A God that could be real, Abrams shows us, is what humanity needs to inspire us to collectively cooperate to protect our warming planet and create a long-term civilization.</p><p><b>Nancy Ellen Abrams</b> is coauthor with Joel R. Primack, of <i>The View from the Center of the Universe</i> and <i>The New Universe and the Human Future</i>.<b>From Chapter 2: "A God That Can't Be Real</b><br><br>Science can never tell you with certainty what&#x2019;s true, since there&#x2019;s always the possibility that some future discovery will rule it out. But science can often tell you with certainty what&#x2019;s not true. Galileo, for example, showed with telescopic evidence that the heavenly spheres could not exist, even though he could not actually prove that Earth moves around the sun. When scientists produce the evidence that convincingly rules out the impossible, there&#x2019;s no point in arguing. It&#x2019;s over. Grace lies in accepting and recalculating. That&#x2019;s how science moves forward.<br><br>What if we thought this way about God? What if we took the evidence of a new cosmic reality seriously and became willing to rule out the impossible? What if we cleared away those distracting<br>notions of God that can&#x2019;t be true in the kind of universe we actually live in? God can be imagined to do or be anything, but the goal of this book is to find a God that is real.<br><br>It&#x2019;s amazing how many unnecessary requirements have gotten tacked onto God. Unnecessary requirements are harmful. They divide us from each other, since different people see them differently; worse, they divide us from our own rational selves. A religion that credits God with powers that can&#x2019;t exist in this universe sets its followers up for inevitable doubt, which in turn requires of them an exhausting effort to jack up their faith in order to fight the evidence against it. This is self-sabotage. People are expending all that effort and worry to defend &#x201c;characteristics&#x201d; of God that no one really needs.<br><br>So here&#x2019;s a chance to pare our definition of God down to the essentials.<br><br>In my quest for a believable higher power, I decided to look one by one at the reasons God seemed unbelievable and ask if they really matter or whether they are merely traditional attributes. The results of this exercise amazed me.<br><br>Not one characteristic that conflicts with science turns out to<i> matter</i>. We can let them go.<br><br>Shakespeare said it best in<i> Richard II</i>: &#x201c;Superfluous branches we lop away that bearing boughs may live.&#x201d; Here are the branches that must be lopped away that a real God may live. These beliefs can&#x2019;t be literally true in our universe. To the extent we cling to these images, even as metaphors, we are rejecting the real universe:<br><br>1. God existed before the universe.<br>2. God created the universe.<br>3. God knows everything.<br>4. God plans what happens.<br>5. God can choose to violate the laws of nature.<br><br>I know that approaching with any level of scientific rigor something so personal, so cherished, so core touching as God may be hard at first. But the price of a real God is that we have to consciously let go of what makes it unreal. God can&#x2019;t be everything or it will be nothing. We all need hope and comfort and inspiration, but we also need the built-in bullshit detector of science.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve never taken these five ideas literally but instead have seen God as simply a word for the sense of wonder, of the unknown, of endless possibility, of cosmic connection, and of the opportunity to not need all the answers, then it may perhaps seem silly to bother refuting them one by one. Yet I would be surprised if your sense of wonder, of the unknown cosmic connection, and endless possibility connected with the idea of God was not based on an unconscious lifelong association of God with at least some of these impossible characteristics.<br><br><i>1. God could not have existed before the universe.</i><br><br>The history of the universe tells us that complexity evolves from simpler states of being, so there could not have been an intelligence complex enough to design anything at all, let alone a universe, before cosmic evolution even began.<br><br>What I&#x2019;m about to say about the universe is based not only on direct astronomical observations but also on supercomputer simulations. The two standard ways of doing astronomy used to be theory and observation, but simulation is a new way. Direct observation of the universe in many cases is impossible, since dark matter and dark energy, which are most of the universe, are invisible, and because events on the scale of the universe happen across such vast stretches of time that a human lifetime is far too short to experience them. Theory is also inadequate because, no matter how sophisticated it may be, it can&#x2019;t predict in any detail the kind of awesome <i>transformations</i> that had to happen for primordial particles and energy to turn into galaxies, stars, and planets. But supercomputers can predict them, to a surprising degree. The availability of supercomputers is a key reason why scientific cosmology has entered a golden age.<br><br>Supercomputers enable scientists to collapse billions of years of evolution into minutes, and billions of light-years onto a computer screen. My husband&#x2019;s team of astrophysicists, for example, has several times simulated the evolution, from the Big Bang to today, of a representative cube of universe a billion light-years on a side. The team ran the simulations according to different theoretical assumptions in order to test those assumptions. The supercomputer&#x2014;the equivalent of fourteen thousand top-of-the-line Intel computers working for two months&#x2014;can track the motions of many billions of particles and cross-correlate their interactions with <i>all</i> the others for (a simulated) 13.8 billion years.<br><br>My husband&#x2019;s team then compares the final universe produced by the simulation to the real universe as telescopes directly observe it; the computers predict what the observational astronomers will find. Only if the simulated and real universes match were the initial assumptions right. They match in incredible detail.* When the simulation is not stopped at today but allowed to run, we are watching a simulation of the future of our universe.<br><br>Not only cosmology but many fields, from neuroscience to climate science, have leaped ahead since the advent of supercomputer simulation. Here, in an abbreviated and simplified form, is what<br>modern cosmology tells us about our origins.<br><br>Right after the Big Bang there was nothing but rapidly moving elementary particles and energy, not even atoms yet, though the simplest atoms, hydrogen and helium, formed after a few hundred<br>thousand years. The early universe was smooth, expanding but not turbulent. Spacetime (space and time in the universe have since Einstein been understood to be a continuum) came into existence wrinkled, and the wrinkles expanded with the universe. For billions of years primeval particles of dark matter flowed toward the wrinkles by gravitational attraction alone. The dark matter formed clumps along the wrinkles through a process that astronomers enigmatically call &#x201c;violent relaxation.&#x201d; Up to here, our cosmic history was simple, governed by pure physics. Scientists deeply understand that era. But as time passed, enormous transformations came about,<br>and the complexity that resulted is much harder to understand. The immense gravity of the dark matter clumps drew in clouds of hydrogen and helium, which cooled and collapsed to the centers of the clumps, igniting as stars. Surrounded by a halo of dark matter, the stars cooked up inside themselves the heavier atoms, like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and the nearly a hundred natural atoms that are heavier than helium and make up most of the periodic table of the elements. The biggest stars exploded in supernovas and spewed these heavy atoms into space as pure stardust to soar for eons. The intermingling stardust of thousands of supernovas, which had occurred over many eras, got pulled into the gravitational field of our forming solar system, and 4.6 billion years ago the stardust condensed into the rocky planets, including Earth. Hundreds of millions of years passed before the earliest life evolved here, and billions more before intelligence evolved that was complex enough to understand the idea of creation. The evolution of such complexity takes a long time.<br><br>This is the kind of universe we live in. This is where our thinking should start.<br><br>Something as complex as a mind capable of planning and creating the universe could not possibly have been there to do so.<br><br>What&#x2019;s more, it&#x2019;s not clear where &#x201c;there&#x201d; would be, since cosmologists are continually pushing back the beginning. The Big Bang used to be thought of as the beginning, but the larger theory of cosmic inflation now explains what set up the initial conditions for the Big Bang and caused the wrinkles that later attracted dark matter. The theory of cosmic inflation has made five specific predictions, and the four that have been tested so far have all been confirmed by observation, so the theory has become part of the standard model of cosmology. Astrophysicists have also extrapolated backward from cosmic inflation, theorizing what may have happened before. This theory is called eternal inflation, and it posits a pure quantum state of being outside our universe that, once begun, can never stop and may continue eternally, producing multiple universes, including ours. Where, in that case, would the beginning be?<br><br>Let&#x2019;s suppose the theory of eternal inflation turns out to be right. Does eternal into the future require eternal into the past? Not clear. It&#x2019;s not even clear what &#x201c;eternal into the past&#x201d; might mean. In eternal inflation not even an atom can form. No information can be preserved in any way, and thus no meaningful past could exist.<br><br>Furthermore, &#x201c;eternal into the future&#x201d; is not even a meaningful concept <i>inside</i> our universe. The largest structures in our universe are called superclusters of galaxies. They will exist for many billions more years, but gradually the dark energy that&#x2019;s causing the universe to expand faster and faster will tear them apart. Unlike superclusters of galaxies, our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is bound together by gravity, which will permanently prevent dark energy from tearing it apart. Instead our Milky Way will merge in five billion years or so with our neighboring large galaxy, Andromeda, and tens of smaller nearby galaxies will also fall into the forming megagalaxy that we might call Milky Andromeda. New stars will keep forming, and Milky Andromeda will shine on for a <i>trillion</i> more years, hundreds of times longer than Earth has existed. That&#x2019;s pretty close to eternal&#x2014;but not the same.<br><br>The fact is, &#x201c;in the beginning&#x201d; is no more precise than &#x201c;once upon a time.&#x201d; The beginning is just a line we draw in our minds to be able to start telling a story. The end is a line we draw to stop. They have no objective reality. They can&#x2019;t even be defined, let alone explained. So demanding to know the very beginning of the universe is as misguided as trying to understand the last moment of the universe.<br><br>*You can watch visualizations of these simulations on the website for the most recent book I coauthored with my husband, The New Universe and the Human Future, http://new<br>-universe.org.</p><h2>Shorter Works for Pianoforte Solo (Dover Classical Piano Music)</h2><p><p>Supplementing the Dover edition of Schubert's complete piano sonatas, this volume contains all of the remainder of Schubert's music for pianoforte solo (except the dances and a few unfinished pieces): the ever popular "Wanderer" fantasy, Opus 15; the 8 impromptus (Opp. 90 and 142), experimental forerunners of one of the typical genres of the later Romantic composers; the Moments Musicals, Opus 94; the Adagio and Rondo, Opus 145; and numerous variations, scherzos, and other short pieces.<br>The music is photographically reprinted from the Breitkopf &amp; H�rtel <i>Schubert-Gesammtausgabe</i>, still considered the standard, authoritative edition of Schubert's music.<br>Note heads in this edition have been reproduced in a size large enough to be read easily at the keyboard, and margins and spaces between staves are conveniently wide to permit written notes, harmonic analysis, fingerings, and running measure numbers.

This gave her access to powerful, intuitive, and healing capacities, and influenced her change in career, from pioneering community arts policy at the national level in Ireland to opening a healing practice. She worked closely with a team of medical doctors researching the spiritual causes underpinning clinical depression. The findings culminated in a residential program that O&#x2019;Keeffe developed, which successfully treated depression. In 2003, she left Ireland to deepen her spiritual practice. After a two-year period of no thoughts, the self-referencing mechanism that creates the sense of a personal &#x201c;I&#x201d; had dissolved. O&#x2019;Keeffe began to work as a spiritual teacher in 2008. She now guides others in her teachings and publications in order to share what she has learned, and assists others to transcend both dual and non-dual perspectives. She also prepares those who have had sustained spiritual awakenings for liberation.&#x201c;From the moment of our first breath, we begin a long and at times arduous journey of mental conditioning, one of creating our individual and social selves. In <i>How to Be a Spiritual Rebel</i>, Jac O&#x2019;Keeffe astutely guides us how to leave this conditioning and its endless searching behind for a new life beyond boundaries, beyond limitations. In such a life, each moment is lived not by conditions of the mind but rather by your inner spiritual nature, which guides you in an ongoing and ever-blossoming transformation of openness to and participation in life itself.

Grant (American Presidency Series)</h2><p>As controversial in politics as he was in the military, Ulysses S. Grant (1822&#x2013;1885) was an embattled president, enormously popular with the American people, yet the target of unrelenting censure by political enemies. For the first time in almost a century, this book by the distinguished historian Charles W. Calhoun examines Grant&#x2019;s administration in depth, offering a fresh look at the 18th president&#x2019;s policies and actions during his two terms in office (1869&#x2013;1877).<br><br>Most biographers focus on Grant&#x2019;s military career, giving less attention to the significant and complex questions that marked his presidential terms. These concerns, the issues of politics and governance, are at the core of this book. As a political historian with a vast knowledge of nineteenth-century America and an extensive array of original sources at his command, Calhoun approaches Grant&#x2019;s presidency not as an incongruous or inconsequential sequel to his military career but instead as the polestar of American public life during a crucial decade in the nation's political development. He explores Grant&#x2019;s leadership style and traces his contributions to the office of president, including creating a White House staff, employing modern technology to promote the mobility of the presidency, and developing strong ties with congressional leaders to enhance executive influence over legislation. <br><br><i>The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant</i> provides a detailed discussion of the administration&#x2019;s endeavors in a variety of areas&#x2014;Reconstruction and civil rights, economic policy, the Peace Policy for Native Americans, foreign policy, and civil service reform. It also offers a straightforward examination of the scandals associated with the period, highlighting the &#x201c;embattled&#x201d; nature of Grant&#x2019;s presidency and the deep antagonism that marked his relations with key critics such as Charles Sumner, Henry Adams, and Benjamin Bristow. In sum, this book is a long overdue re-evaluation of a pivotal presidency in America&#x2019;s political history.</p><p>Charles W. Calhoun, Thomas Harriot College Distinguished Professor of History <i>emeritus</i> at East Carolina University, is the author of many books, including <i>Conceiving a New Republic: The Republican Party and the Southern Question, 1869&#x2013;1900</i> and <i>Minority Victory: Gilded Age Politics and the Front Porch Campaign of 1888</i>, both from Kansas."Calhoun&#x2019;s work deserves to educate the public as to how a general can ride a wave of popular support to change the nation while avoiding demagoguery."&#x2014;<i><b>The History</b></i><p>"Calhoun, one of the most gifted historians of the Gilded Age, turns his attention to the Grant administration with a meticulously researched, shrewdly argued, and elegantly written contribution."--<i><b>Journal of Southern History</b></i></p><p>"Calhoun breaks the mould of works that have explored Grant's presidency.

Well-researched and well-written, this book is a must read for scholars and others interested in gaining accurate insight about a major American leader."--<b>John F. Marszalek</b>, Giles Distinguished Professor Emeritus of History and executive director of the Ulysses S.

Grant's reputation as a politician and chief executive has improved during the past three decades. Now comes Charles W. Calhoun's comprehensive overview of the eighteenth president's administration, examining both its achievements and shortcomings with discerning insight. At last Grant can claim fair treatment in this judicious study."--<b>Brooks D. Simpson</b>, author of <i>The Reconstruction Presidents</i></p><p>"This extraordinary history helps restore the reputation of a genuine American hero. This volume, the first to cover the Grant presidency in over two generations, is a window on eight years of success and attempts to reconcile sections of a country still at war with itself. The author is fair in portraying Grant as energized, patriotic, and loyal--sometimes too loyal. Far from being a corrupt administration, Grant's strengths as a leader have a profound positive effect on American culture in civil liberties for African Americans, the American economy, and diplomacy. This is a must read for all who cherish the American republic."--<b>Frank J. Williams</b> is the President of The Ulysses S.

In more than seventeen years of working with victims and survivors, she discovered that this simplistic formula is far from true. Most survivors, in her experience, break free from the patterns of victimization and abuse and go on to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. And the more than twenty interviewed in depth by Sanford provide vivid proof that full recovery is possible. As they discuss key issues, such as self-image, intimacy, work and spirituality, we come to see what enables them, and countless others like them, to triumph over trauma and become not only strong, but often strongest where they&#39;ve been most injured- strong at the broken places.</p><p>Linda T.

Told with clarity and originality, this story uses one fascinating case study to illuminate the industrial development and environmental transformation of the American West during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br><br>The process by which two neighborhood butchers turned themselves into landed industrialists depended to an extraordinary degree on the acquisition, manipulation, and exploitation of natural resources. David Igler examines the broader impact that industrialism--as exemplified by Miller &amp; Lux--had on landscapes and waterscapes, and on human as well as plant and animal life in the West. He also provides a rich discussion of the social relations engineered by Miller &amp; Lux, from the dispossession of Californio rancheros to the ethnic segmentation of the firm's massive labor force. The book also covers such topics as land acquisition and reclamation, water politics, San Francisco's unique business environment, and the city's relation to its surrounding hinterlands. Above all, Igler highlights essential issues that resonate for us today: who holds the right and who has the power to engineer the landscape for market production?</p><p>"Ambitiously conceived, abundantly researched, effectively plotted, elegantly composed, and concisely argued, Igler's study of the rise and fall of Miller &amp; Lux will be hailed as a landmark contribution.

In <b>The Kid</b>, Savage tells a no-holds-barred, high-energy story of an ordinary American couple who wants to have a baby. Except that in this case the couple happens to be Dan and his boyfriend. That fact, in the face of a society enormously uneasy with gay adoption, makes for an edgy, entertaining, and illuminating read. When Dan and his boyfriend are finally presented with an infant badly in need of parenting, they find themselves caught up in a drama that extends well beyond the confines of their immediate world. A story about confronting homophobia, falling in love, getting older, and getting a little bit smarter, The Kid is a book about the very human desire to have a family.</p><p>Best known for his syndicated sexual advice column, "Savage Love," Dan Savage shares his own story in <i>The Kid</i>, a hilarious account of his efforts--along with his partner--to adopt a child. (Whoops, make that his boyfriend; Savage can't stand the "genderless" P-word: "Straight people and press organs that want to acknowledge gay relationships while at the same time pushing the two-penises stuff as far out of their minds as possible love 'partner.' I hated it.") Savage doesn't give an inch on the sexuality issue; it's hard to imagine that a homophobic reader would even pick up <i>The Kid</i>, but if it happened, Savage's unapologetic presentation of his life would quickly scare that reader off. Which isn't to say that he paints a rosy picture of homosexual cohabitation: the very first scene finds Dan's boyfriend, Terry, locking himself in the bathroom after a fight over the music on the car stereo. The misadventures continue through each step of the open-adoption process, in which Dan and Terry get to know their baby's birth mother, and the first few weeks of parenthood. <i>The Kid</i> is a wonderful, charming account of real "family values" that proves love knows no limits.From Dan Savage, the writer whose sex-advice column, "Savage Love", enrages and excites four million people every week, comes the story of his journey into parenthood.<p>For Dan and his boyfriend Terry, the odyssey begins at a seminar in Portland where (after rejecting the idea of making a "biokid" with a lesbian couple, a lesbian single, and their straight next-door neighbor), they decide on an "open adoption". The birth mother who selects them as the adoptive parents for her child is a street kid named Melissa, who drinks and uses drugs during pregnancy and who, despite doctor's orders, is still living on the streets. As Dan and Terry tag along on her prenatal visits and the due date rapidly approaches, the fears common to adoptive parents mount: What if the baby isn't healthy? What if we aren't parent material? What if the birth mother changes her mind and decides to keep the baby?</p><p>In The Kid, Dan Savage shares his views on what it means to be gay and raising a child in America today. In the process, he takes his usual scathingly funny potshots at everything from growing up gay to committing to a younger man, from the gay left to the religious right, homophobia...love...getting fat...getting married...getting older...and the very human desire to have a family.</p></p><h2>A Murder for the Books (A Blue Ridge Library Mystery)</h2><p><b>Librarian Amy Webber must archive overdue crimes and deadly rumors before a killer strikes again in her new Virginia home in Victoria Gilbert&#x2019;s charming series debut.</b><br><br>Fleeing a disastrous love affair, university librarian Amy Webber moves in with her aunt in a quiet, historic mountain town in Virginia.

A quiet, simple man and army veteran, Noah is haunted by the horrors he witnessed when his infantry unit liberated Dachau. Wandering the South, he seeks both to escape the past and to find a place to call home. <br> Noah is initially treated with amusement by the people of Bowerstown -- until he begins fishing. For Noah possesses an almost magical ability with a rod and reel. He soon becomes the talk of the valley and is urged to stay long enough to participate in the annual school fishing contest. He agrees, finding lodging in an abandoned shack by what is known as the Lake of Grief, which the locals believe holds no fish. Noah knows they are wrong; beneath the water is a warrior bass waiting to test Noah's gift. But above the water, Noah's innocence catches the heart of Eleanor Cunningham, whose husband supposedly killed himself after returning from the war. Over the course of a week, Noah will be led into the private lives of the residents of the Valley of Light, will join them as they mourn a tragedy, and will experience a miracle that will guide him home at last. <br> Uplifting, memorable, and deeply emotional, <i>The Valley of Light</i> is the finest work to date from a brilliant teller of heartfelt tales.</p><p><b>Terry Kay</b>'s novels include <i>Taking Lottie Home, The Runaway, Shadow Song,</i> and the now-classic <i>To Dance with the White Dog,</i> twice nominated for the American Booksellers Book of the Year Award, and winner of the Southeastern Library Association Book of the Year Award. Terry Kay has been married for 44 years and has four children and seven grandchildren. He lives in Athens, Georgia.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>He made his way to the lake watchfully, crossing the bulldozer-built dam that was covered in weed-grass across its ridge and in trash trees growing on the waterside. It was late afternoon. The sun was behind him, his shadow making a long ghost that wobbled over the weed-grass. Grasshoppers sailed away from his footsteps.<br><br>At a clearing among the trash trees on the east end of the dam, he stopped and surveyed the ground. The lake had not been fished in a long time, he believed. Weed-grass grew high, with no look of being trampled. Left-behind bait cans were old and rusty. A coil of nylon line dangled like a spider's silk from a limb of one of the nearby trash trees, causing him to smile a smile that did not show on his face, knowing the spit of frustration the miscast had caused in some fisherman. A child's cast most likely. Not easy for a child to make a cast with nylon. Would be better to teach him with braided line.<br><br>He thought about the fishermen who had abandoned the lake. Once, they had come to it from the logging road, he reasoned, bringing their families in wagons or trucks, chairs to sit on, fishing early to late with long bamboo poles and cork floats, eating their sausages and sardines and baked sweet potatoes, and at day's end taking home their stringers of bream and bass and catfish, muscle-weary, smelling of fish slime and worms.<br><br>The water of the lake was the color of dark tea in the late-day shadows. Acid from trees. He closed his eyes, listened. The water lapped softly against the bank, rolled in, seeped back. The lapping sound was like a slow and lazy pulse beat. A dozing lake. Not much different from an old man sleeping in sunshine. Just enough breathing to keep alive.<br><br>A good place. A good place.<br><br>He wondered if it was the lake he had heard of. His sense told him it was.<br><br>A hundred yards or so up the east side of the lake, he had seen a small frame building that seemed empty from his distant view, though it was hard to tell since it had a screened-in porch, the screen hiding whatever was behind it. Probably a shack used by hunters, he had reasoned, remembering such shacks from his childhood. If somebody lived in it full-time, they did a good job of making it appear deserted.<br><br>Whoever it was that owned the lake and the shack had a good place.<br><br>He squatted at the lake's edge, placing the fishing rod he carried on the ground, and then he leaned forward and lightly touched the palm of his hand on the surface of the water.<br><br>Tell me, he said silently, said inside his mind.<br><br>The water was cool. Against his palm it had a ticklish feel of silk.<br><br>Yes, a good place.<br><br>He pushed his fingers into the water and wiggled them, paused, let his eyes scan the lake.<br><br>Forty feet away, against the bank, the water roiled, quivered like a muscle.<br><br>He smiled again, held his fingers in the water, watched the roiling ripple toward him in perfect circles. Soon, the first ring touched him. He pulled his hand from the water and lifted it to his face and inhaled slowly, taking in the scents of the lake. Algae. The decay of trees pushed over by wind storms and dropped into the water. Hickory, oak, beechnut, sweet gum. Silt of leaves and wash-off of wood dirt. Frog and snake and turtle. And fish. The sharp, almost metallic scent of fish.<br><br>He rubbed his hand across the front of his shirt.<br><br>A very good place.<br><br>He stood and slipped the army knapsack he wore off his shoulder, then picked up the rod and pulled loose the line on the bait-casting reel, letting the lure dangle before him. It was an old lure, turned like a small minnow with silver flecks on its sides. He had caught many fish with it before snipping off the hook with a pair of wire cutters. It was now a lure for holding his line on the rod and for teasing.<br><br>One cast, he thought.<br><br>One cast to let Mr. Fish know he was there.<br><br>Enough to anger Mr. Fish, to make him restless.<br><br>Make him coil and leap at anything moving near him.<br><br>He tilted his rod to the water, dipped the lure, wetting it. Then he made his cast near the bank where the fish -- a bass, a largemouth, he believed -- had rolled. He watched the lure slap the water, dive and disappear, and then he began his slow reeling-in of the line. He could feel the lure drag through algae and he flicked his wrist twice, giving the line a jerking motion.<br><br>A cloud skimmed the July sun, dimmed it. He felt a puff of air against his face and stood motionless to let the air pause on his skin. A sense of peace settled over him as though he had marked the place he stood on a map and, after a long journey, had arrived at his destination. He wondered what day of the week it was and the date marking the day. Thought: What does it matter?<br><br>For more than two years, he had walked into days and weeks and months without knowing them by calendar, only by season. The season he read in trees -- lime-green buds in spring, full-leaf in summer, colors of hot embers in autumn, the dark limbs of winter. He had walked and fished, leaving behind war and the burial ground of his parents and the sadness of his brother and the open and the secret experiences of his boyhood. Walked far enough to stop looking over his shoulder to see if his history tagged after him like a scolded yard dog. Now it was only memory, and memory had a way of rubbing down most of the rough edges.<br><br>Still, he had always believed there would be a place to stop the walking, to stay, to become his own forest, show his own seasons.<br><br>And there, with the air on his skin, he wondered if he had found that place.<br><br>Three weeks earlier -- in Kentucky, he believed -- he had come upon an old, white-haired man with bowed shoulders fishing from a bridge over a wide, slow-moving river. They had made nods to one another and he had gone below the bridge to the riverbank and made his touch of the water, and then had joined the old man on the bridge and unreeled his own line over the bridge's railing and they had fished together for a long while, paying more attention to the talking that went on between them than to the fish that swam in the water below them.<br><br>The man, who offered his name as Hoke Moore, had put him on the path to the valley. Had said it was a good place to find fish and rest if a person could avoid certain elements of the population. "It's called the Valley of Light by some, Bowerstown by others. Where I was born," he had added in a voice that had the sound of longing. "They's some good people there, and some you'd just as soon not get caught with. Mostly good, though. Mostly good. You need a hand, they'll give it."<br><br>And then Hoke Moore had begun telling of a great lake called the Chatuge, built some years earlier as part of a government project called the Tennessee Valley Authority. Said word of the lake gave it good enough marks for fishing, though there were still too few fish for all the water pooled up behind the dam. "Takes time for fish to find out where they want to be when they's so many places to go," he had speculated.<br><br>He had never fished the Chatuge himself, Hoke Moore had admitted. Liked smaller places, something he could walk around and not lose sight of where he'd started the trip. "They's another little lake over there -- twenty or twenty-five acres, I'd guess -- that's got the biggest fish I ever seen in it. A bass, it was. Must have been fifteen pounds. Maybe more. Used to try and catch him, but all he'd do was spit water on me. He'd jump up out of the water, like he was trying to swim through the air, mad as a wet hen. Never seen a bass do that. Not one that big. Not coming out of the water high as he did. It was like he was telling me I weren't good enough to catch him."<br><br>Hoke Moore had paused and turned to look in the direction of the far-off mountains in the southeast -- the direction he had given as the location of the valley -- and he had added, "Must be big as a whale now, if it's still alive. You just wandering around, you ought to go down there and try to catch him. You might can do it. Might can. You a fisherman, sure enough. I can tell that in any man just by studying him a little bit. If you go down there and you catch him, you look him in the eye when you drag him up and you tell him Hoke Moore's been thinking about him for a long time."<br><br>He had smiled, had said, "Yes sir. I get down that way, I'll do that."<br><br>"You got to take your time with him," Hoke Moore had said. "Got to aggravate him some. Got to make him want you, much as you want him."<br><br>"Yes sir, I've seen fish like that," he had replied. And it was true. Even as a child, he had known fish liked to fight, some more than others.<br><br>And then Hoke Moore had chuckled and made another soft cast with his line, watching the hook disappear under the pull of the sinker. After a moment, he had said, "I wonder if they doing the fish-off in the Chatuge these days."<br><br>He had asked, "What's that?"<br><br>"What I call it -- a fish-off," Hoke Moore had answered. "Used to be on the river. Been going on over there for twenty years or more. Got started by the school as a way of making some money to pay teachers. First year they done it, they was catching fish fast as they could drop a line. Not much need to bait the hook, they was catching fish so easy. Had the biggest fry at the school I ever saw. You'd of thought Jesus had blessed them fish, they was so many of them. Everybody pays a dollar or two to get in on it and the man that catches the most fish by weight gets a cash prize. Used to be ten dollars. Guess it's more now. When they get through with the fishing, they have them a fish fry and everybody in the valley shows up. That's where they make the money."<br><br>Hoke Moore had paused, wagged his fishing rod over the water; then he had added, "Won it myself two or three times." Had laughed softly over the thought.<br><br>"When's it held?" he had asked.<br><br>"Right along now," Hoke Moore had answered. "July, August. Date changes about -- or it used to. Tell the truth, I don't even know if they do it no more. War changed a lot of things." He had paused, clucked with his tongue, shook his head slowly, had added, "Had me some ups and downs there, but I miss the place." He had gazed again at the distant mountains. "You just going place to place, you ought to head down that way. Get in on that fishing if they still doing it. Catch that fish of mine while you there."<br><br>"Maybe I will," he had said after a moment of thinking about it.<br><br>d<br><br>"What you ought to do," Hoke Moore had urged. Had said again, "You a fisherman. Yes sir, you are. One thing I know about is fishing. Some people just born to it. Others can't do nothing but drown worms. You born to it, boy. You born to it. Just like I was."<br><br>"You going back over there someday?" he had asked, wanting to be friendly.<br><br>And Hoke Moore had turned slightly to look at him in an old man's studying way before answering, "About all I ever think about, you want to know the truth of it, but it's a long way off for old legs. If I go back, somebody'll have to throw me over his shoulders and carry me. You take a mind to go on down there, I'll consider I'm along for the ride." And he had smiled and turned back to his fishing and to his low-voice way of talking.<br><br>He had listened with interest to Hoke Moore, had found something pleasing in the description of the valley and had made his turn in the direction of Hoke Moore's pointed finger, walking toward the far-off mountains, so distant and pale gray on the horizon, they had the look of a lace hem on the blue skirt of the sky. Had made his journey at a languid pace, catching an occasional ride in a farmer's truck, stopping often to fish. One river in Tennessee -- the Ocoee -- had held him for three days with its hypnotic run of water over rocks and with the satisfying look of the mountains around it. Good fishing, too. If Hoke Moore had not told such a happy story about the valley near the Chatuge, he would have liked staying longer on the Ocoee.<br><br>But maybe Hoke Moore had been right. The valley had a natural feel to it. Coming into it, he had got an idea of the people living in it by studying the washings hanging on clotheslines. Reading a clothesline had always been an easy thing for him to do -- a trick taught to him by his mother. If you read it with some careful attention, you could tell if the house belonged to a couple just starting out, or if it had children, or old people, or whether they were fat or skinny people. Could come close to guessing how much money the people might have by the new or faded look of their clothing and bedsheets and towels.<br><br>The clotheslines of the valley left him believing it was a place fairly well off, with people more or less settled in, happy enough to be where they were and who they were.<br><br>It was little wonder that Hoke Moore had a yearning look when he pointed out the direction of the valley.<br><br>He saw the water behind the line heave and bubble, and he raised the tip of the rod. He knew what was about to happen.<br><br>"Take it," he whispered.<br><br>The fish erupted from the water, flinging itself high, like a god becoming flesh, a spray of water spinning from its silver head, its tail fins dancing over the shattered surface. For a moment -- a flash -- the huge mouth flared open in outrage at the tasteless lure and he could see the orange of the gills shining in the sun.<br><br>He had never seen a lake fish so large.<br><br>The fish fell hard against the water, making a belly-flopping slapping sound, a sound like a sudden thunderclap, and then it disappeared. Water rippled again in circles and the late sun filled the circles like ringlets of liquid gold.<br><br>Hoke Moore's fish, he believed.<br><br>Hoke Moore's fish announcing itself, coming out of the water like that. Not the habit of bass to leap up, though it depended on the spirit of the fish, he guessed. He had seen such leaps. Not so high, though. Not from such a large fish.<br><br>Soon, he thought. Maybe tomorrow. Soon, I will catch you and see if you are the giant Hoke Moore says you are.<br><br>The fish would bring good money, being so big. Feed a good-size family, though it might not be easy finding somebody wanting a bass as big as a small pig. Most country people he knew -- white and colored -- liked the taste of catfish more than bass. So did he. Catfish -- small ones, the length of his hand, wrist to fingertip -- were as tasty as any fish he had ever eaten if they were cooked right in seasoned meal and melted lard. Some of the colored men he had fished with in his boyhood would come close to fighting over a string of catfish. One he knew -- Runt Carter was his name -- had a habit of collecting the heads of catfish and stringing them across his barn with binder twine, saying the fish kept away owls. Runt Carter had so many catfish heads dangling on binder twine, his barn had the look of wearing a necklace.<br><br>He wondered if there were many colored families in the valley. Doubted it, being in the mountains. Most colored people he knew were workers in cotton fields, and there was little cotton grown in the mountains. He had seen only one colored family in the last two days. They lived in a small house -- if it could be called house, for it was more barnlike than houselike. Remembered watching three or four small, knobby-shouldered black children at play as he came upon the house, and then seeing them become suddenly quiet, suddenly motionless, like small deer going on guard, their eyes following him as he walked past them.<br><br>It was a family that would like catfish, and maybe he would catch some and take a stringer to them. It would be easy enough to do, though the walk to where they lived was a good distance.

Nine year-old Alder was captured and taken to Ohio by Indians in 1782. Adopted by a Mingo warrior and his Shawnee wife, Alder lived as an Indian until 1805. After he left the Indians, Alder became one of the first European settlers to live in central Ohio. Alder composed his memoirs in the 1840s. His account chronicles his life for fifty years, from the time of his capture to 1832. The narrative, therfore, provides a unique perspective on fronteir Ohio and its transformation from wilderness to statehood and the continuing evolution in the relationship between Ohio&#39;s Indians and whites from the Revolutionary War-era to a time when many of the state&#39;s Native peoples had been removed. Alder&#39;s recollection provides an exceptional look at early Ohio. His portrait of his captors is revealing, complex, and sympathetic. The latter part of his narrative in which he describes his experiences in central Ohio is an extraordinary rich account of early pioneer life. Further, Alder was fortunate in that he encountered many of the persons and took part in many of the events that have become touchstones in Ohio&#39;s pioneer history, including Simon Kenton, Simon Girty, and Col. William Crawford. He participated in the Battles of Fort Recovery and Fallen Timbers, and his recollection of these actions are among the few extant accounts that describe these events from a Native American perspective.</p><p>Larry L.

Jackson, a well-known TV and film writer&#x2014;and veteran of many years of traditional therapy&#x2014;has never been a drunk or a drug abuser, but she realized that many of the tenets of Williams&#x2019;s program could apply to her. In <i>Gratitude and Trust</i>, Williams and Jackson ask: What happens to those who struggle with vexing problems yet are not full-blown addicts? Are there any lessons to be learned from the foundational and time-tested principles of the recovery movement?<br><br>Whether you&#x2019;re tethered to your phone or you turn to food for comfort; whether you&#x2019;re a perfectionist and can&#x2019;t let things go or are too afraid to fail to even try; whether you can find intimacy only on the Internet or you&#x2019;ve been involved in a string of nasty relationships&#x2014;the first step toward feeling better about yourself and your life is the realization that you are what&#x2019;s standing in your way. Williams and Jackson have designed a new, positive program, based on a half-dozen new affirmations, that can help conquer your vices, address personal dysfunction, and start to brighten the darkest moods. <i>Gratitude and Trust</i> is an essential, inspirational, and uplifting guide to identifying and changing maladaptive behaviors in order to uncover your most productive, healthiest self.</p><p><b>Paul Williams </b>is an Oscar, Grammy, and Golden Globe winning Hall of Fame songwriter ("Rainbow Connection," "Evergreen," and "We've Only Just Begun") and President of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP).

Say it clearly. Close the door if you don&#x2019;t want anyone to hear you. Admitting you have a problem is the first stop on the high-functioning express: If you don&#x2019;t own it, you can&#x2019;t fix it. So before you do anything else, make this declaration, be it on paper, in front of the mirror, or as a mantra you repeat to yourself.<br>2. IDENTIFY YOUR PROBLEM.<br><br>Before you can begin to change your behavior, you must know what it is you&#x2019;re changing. We&#x2019;ve isolated many common problems in this chapter; one or several may be yours.<br>3. HOW IS YOUR BEHAVIOR AFFECTING YOUR LIFE?<br><br>How do we know when our maladaptive behaviors have crossed the line? We often don&#x2019;t. And we usually have a well-worn list of excuses for how they haven&#x2019;t. We&#x2019;ve included a questionnaire in this chapter that will tell you if your &#x201c;issues&#x201d; have grown to unacceptable proportions. If you&#x2019;re reading this, we&#x2019;re guessing they have.<br>4. ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE TIME FOR CHANGE IS NOW. The time has come to commit to a better way of living. &#x201c;Soon&#x201d; is not a time. &#x201c;After Thanksgiving&#x201d; is not a time. &#x201c;After I&#x2019;ve finished my exams&#x201d; is not a time. Now is a time. Look at your watch. Write down what time it is. Write down the date. This is the moment your new life has begun.<br>We are all human, thus we all make mistakes. Many of us make the same mistakes over and over and over again. In fact, we seldom make new ones because bad habits are just the repetition of mistakes, be they conscious or unconscious. Addiction enters our lives when we let the momentary pleasure or pain avoidance of those habits hijack our critical thinking and affect our behavior in ways that are either life threatening or life limiting. &#x201c;Addiction,&#x201d; &#x201c;bad habits,&#x201d; &#x201c;poor life choices&#x201d;&#x2014;call them what you will: They all fall under the heading of &#x201c;Lack of Impulse Control.&#x201d;</p><p>Do you talk about something you never get around to doing? Do you make grandiose, life-changing plans you never end up realizing? Do you find yourself saying, &#x201c;This is my last [fill in the blank]&#x201d;: My last cheeseburger. My last affair with a married man. My last charge on my already overused credit cards. My last lie to Mom, Dad, myself. The last time I do not do what I promise myself I will.&nbsp; &#x201c;Tomorrow I start over.&#x201d; &#x201c;New leaf.&#x201d; &#x201c;Never again.&#x201d; &#x201c;One more time and that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d; Are you a member of the &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll start tomorrow&#x201d; club but tomorrow never comes? Are you easily derailed by the opinion of others? Does your own fear-based thinking hold you back? Does the idea of staying where you are, no matter how uncomfortable, make you feel safer than moving toward something that might actually make you happy? Are you ignoring any signs of danger ahead?</p><p>The advantage (if you can call it that) that addicts have is that they have their identifiable addictions. Whether you are an alcoholic, a drug addict, a compulsive gambler, or an uncontrollable overeater, you know what you are fighting. But if you are a woman who makes poor love choices, a serial philanderer, someone who sabotages friendships in the workplace by gossiping, someone whose go-to emotion is fear, or someone whose neediness drives people away, there is a good chance you have remained blissfully unaware of your addiction until significant damage has been done. The saddest wake-up call of all is the news that your actions have brought damaging turbulence into your daily life and more often than not the lives of others. Most likely, none of you are lacking for concerned friends or family members who are more than willing to act as human billboards reminding you of where you fall short. You screw up, the wife points out why, you turn to her with a look of intense gratitude and say, &#x201c;Thank God you were there, Cindy. I never noticed. THAT won&#x2019;t happen again!&#x201d; Meanwhile, back in real life, we know that seldom happens. More often than not, the repeated complaints of partners, lovers, and friends only drive us deeper into our cave of &#x201c;Honor thy cravings; screw the rest of the world.&#x201d; Addiction is a powerful foe.</p><p><br>� � �</p><p><br><br>So it may be an unwelcome revelation, but awakening to the fact that the fly in the ointment is&nbsp;you&nbsp;is the beginning of change. The truth is at your door, and with it, the possibility of a new beginning.</p><p><br>PAUL<br><br>In the world of recovery, &#x201c;First things first&#x201d; has become something of a holy commandment. There&#x2019;s a reason such statements become bumper stickers. They&#x2019;re necessary elements to a proper beginning.</p><p>Addiction is in fact a primary disease, meaning it is not a symptom of another disorder. It must be dealt with before any of life&#x2019;s other challenges can be met. Whatever your personal disorder or dysfunction may be, if you are beginning your own path of recovery, the same sense of priorities will serve you best. Deal with your problem. There&#x2019;s no time like the present.<br><br></p><p><br>So what does it take to get us to walk away from stagnant, chronic, destructive behavior? A &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t work now; never really did&#x201d; pattern that has become a habit?<br>If you&#x2019;re not doing a single thing but reading this chapter, then you&#x2019;re already taking a positive step. That&#x2019;s because change begins with the will to change, and finding the will to change is a major triumph. Drug addicts become sick and tired of being sick and tired. Sometimes that&#x2019;s enough: the reality of change or die. For the non&#x2013;life-threatening but life-limiting conditions, the stakes may be smaller but the rewards of change are large. Just the commitment to change, followed by those first attempts at a more constructive behavior, can be comforting. You&#x2019;ll be energized by the thought of a new and better life, one that is free of the daily &#x201c;Oh, no! Not again!&#x201d; moments after vowing to fix things &#x201c;this time.&#x201d; So that said, let&#x2019;s get started.</p><p><br>TRACEY<br><br>In society, we are encouraged to hide our problems and cover up our shame. In the world of recovery, people are applauded for owning their failures.</p><p><br><br><b>Identify Your Problem</b><br>If one gathered together twenty-five random people and made them all stand up and talk about the problems in their lives, every one of them would have made a bad love choice, sabotaged an opportunity, hurt someone while defending their own position, or worried about not being able to control their weight, their temper, their lust for the girl or boy next door. We all have a laundry list of things we have done or continue to do that we are ashamed of and would like to change.</p><p>But before you can change anything, especially something that is most likely harbored in your subconscious, you have to be able to identify it. Let&#x2019;s start at the top:</p><p><br><br><b>The Seven Deadly Sins<br></b><br>Wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony may look like eternal damnation to a Catholic priest, but for some of us they&#x2019;re just a nice way to spend the weekend. I&#x2019;ll have lust and gluttony to start, with a side of greed!</p><p>While you may not feel your behavior can be described in such singularly biblical terms, chances are good that if you take some of your, shall we say, &#x201c;issues&#x201d; and break them down, most likely they will contain elements of this iconic group.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s start with&nbsp;<b>wrath</b>. Someone nabs your parking spot and the first thing out of your mouth is a remark about the other person&#x2019;s maternal parent, followed by a sexual slur? Road rage? Short-tempered with the kids? Boss always pissing you off? Actually, these days everything pisses you off. If that sounds about right, you might have anger issues. Sure, sometimes these feelings can be legitimate, but they still make you a card-carrying member of the Seven Deadly Sin Society. Is &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it later&#x201d; the first thing that comes out of your mouth when a task is presented to you? Is a job half done as acceptable to you as a job well done? Is your house a mess? Your checkbook unbalanced? Your r�sum� not up-to-date? Sounds like<b>sloth</b>. If for you there is any truth to the claim that the average male thinks about sex once a minute,&nbsp;<b>lust</b>&nbsp;is the runaway lead in your Issues to Be Dealt With Department. Same goes for if you&#x2019;re a woman. Lust is one of society&#x2019;s biggest problems. From porn addiction to serial philandering to sexting&#x2014;thanks to modern technology, what once might have been a weekly romp in the Motel 6 has taken on colossal daily devotion. But lust comes in many forms, especially when it comes to our stuff, like your neighbor&#x2019;s car or swimming pool. But we guess we&#x2019;ll be moving on to&nbsp;<b>envy</b>&nbsp;with that one, which is really just the marriage of lust and<b>greed</b>. Obsessing over your coworker&#x2019;s iPad mini? That&#x2019;s envy. Over your coworker&#x2019;s fianc�? Well, that&#x2019;s lust, envy, and greed all rolled up into one.

Without labels we would pour tomato soup on our cereal instead of milk, and pour Drano into the washing machine.</p><p>To help you find the right label, let&#x2019;s have a look at the granddaddy of shopping lists of bad behavior: &#x201c;The Seven Deadly Sins.&#x201d;<br><b>How Is Your Problem Affecting<br>Your Life?</b><br><br></p><p>Everyone feels these things from time to time. And they are by no means entirely bad or destructive. It&#x2019;s when they start to interfere with your life in a disruptive manner that they must be dealt with.</p><p>How do we know when our maladaptive behaviors have crossed the line from the occasional guest appearance to starring in and ruining the show?<br>For alcoholics and drug addicts there is a simple twelve-question test developed by Dr. Robert Siegler that is used to separate the social or problem drinker from the alcoholic. While some of the questions are directly related to alcohol abuse, there are several questions that might help you assess the extent of your own dysfunction.<br>1. Do you lose time from work due to your behavior?<br><br>2. Is your love life suffering due to your behavior?<br><br>3. Is your behavior making your home life unhappy?<br><br>4. Is your behavior affecting your reputation?<br><br>5. Have you gotten into financial difficulties as a result of your behavior?</p><p><br>6. Do you turn to disreputable companions and an inferior environment due to your behavior?</p><p><br>7. Does your behavior make you careless of your family&#x2019;s welfare?</p><p><br>8. Has your ambition decreased as a result of your behavior?<br><br>9. Does your behavior cause you to have difficulty sleeping?<br><br>10. Are you less efficient because of your behavior?<br><br>11. Is your behavior jeopardizing your job or business?<br><br>12. Do you use your behavior to escape from worries or troubles?</p><p><br>And we will take the liberty of adding one important question to the mix:</p><p><br>13. Is your behavior affecting your health in an adverse or dangerous way?<br><br></p><p>Now, if you are living with your madness at a manageable level and would like to keep rolling along in that fashion, you don&#x2019;t need to change a thing. But if you&#x2019;re fed up with your revolving-door anger at life&#x2019;s unfair turns, it&#x2019;s time to look down the barrel of your discontent, own your broken promises, give up your often tried but not so true excuses, and begin to change.</p><p><br><br>PAUL<br><br>One day in my thirteenth year my father missed a turn and drove into an empty cornfield. An angry farmer ran up to the car, looked in the backseat, and upon seeing two frightened children screamed, &#x201c;What the hell is wrong with you? You&#x2019;re drunk! You&#x2019;re going to kill yourself and those kids someday!&#x201d; He was absolutely right, and I suspect my father knew it. Four months later he was dead. He died alone when he drove that car directly into the abutment of a bridge.</p><p>Thirty-five years later I was doing the same thing: driving loaded with my two beautiful children in the backseat of my car. Why do bright, well-educated, and civilized men and women ignore such dark truths and continue on paths of self-destruction?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this point you may be saying, &#x201c;Hey, wait a minute, I&#x2019;m not a drug addict. I keep my booze to a minimum. I would never drive drunk. I make everyone wear a seat belt. I pay the rent on time. Keep gas in the car. Walk through the mall looking and acting like everyone else. I&#x2019;m a version of fine.&#x201d; Then one might ask why you picked up this book. Something must be gnawing on the wires of your psyche. Something must feel out of place in your world.</p><p>There is a lot of information in the promise of this book:&nbsp;Recovery is not just for addicts.&nbsp;You might not have a drug habit, but addiction comes in many forms. It&#x2019;s what takes your mind off of the real issues. It&#x2019;s what keeps you focused on something else instead of the underlying problems. The guy you are stuck on who never follows through&#x2014;it&#x2019;s easy to get mad at him, be on and off with him, rage at him or cry over him. But if you look at your life, was there anyone else who behaved in the same way? Maybe Dad? Are you addicted to the patterns of push-me/pull-you? Is your understanding of interaction with the opposite sex all about confrontation and disappointment? Is the controlling dynamic of your relationships anger, rejection, and conflict? Do things not feel right unless they present wrong?</p><p>Addiction doesn&#x2019;t necessarily imply there are substances involved. Addiction to feelings is a powerful force. Addiction to feeling inadequate, addiction to feeling superior, addiction to feeling like you are always letting people down, addiction to feeling like you will never be the person you want to be, addiction to your excuses for why things don&#x2019;t work out. &#x201c;If I lost twenty pounds, my life would be better. I would have a better job, a better love life, a better apartment. People might like me more.&#x201d; &#x201c;So,&#x201d; one could ask, &#x201c;if you really feel that way, what is keeping you from just cutting back on what you consume and getting out there and moving around? Or are you so addicted to the temporary comfort that food provides that it becomes more important than the guilt and remorse about overconsumption it leaves behind?&#x201d;</p><p>Also, never underestimate the power of habit. Habits keep us tethered to something even if that something is not good for us&#x2014;even if that something is in fact keeping us from what we really want. The reliability of a connection so powerful and long-standing somehow feels safe in a twisted way.</p><p>One of the big barriers to repairing our problems is that we are terrified of what our life will look and feel like without this &#x201c;thing&#x201d; we have become so used to. The thing can be booze, it can be heroin, it can be sugar and fried food, it can be constantly having something to complain about, it can be anything we glom on to that...</p></p><h2>The True Icon: From the Shroud of Turin to the Veil of Manoppello</h2><p>The Shroud of Turin is one of the most famous relics in the world. Scrutinized by scientists and studied by debunkers, it is also honored by countless faithful devoted to the mysterious image of a crucified man that appears on the cloth.In this lavishly illustrated book, best-selling author Paul Badde sets out on a journey through Europe and the Holy Land as he traces the rich history of the Shroud. With the investigative skills of a seasoned journalist, Paul Badde uncovers many of the mysteries surrounding the Shroud and also researches another relic honored as a burial cloth of Christ--the Veil of Manoppello, which bears the image of the Holy Face.Drawing upon his years in Jerusalem and his many visits to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Badde gives a riveting account of the discovery of Christ&#39;s countenance by Peter and John in the dawn of the first Easter. Badde powerfully presents the case that their awe and wonder at the sight of the True Icon needs to be rediscovered in our own time.</p><p><p><b>Paul Badde</b>, born in 1948, is an historian and journalist. Since 2000 he has been an editor of the German newspaper <i>Welt</i>, first as the Jerusalem correspondent and now as The Vatican correspondent in Rome. He is also the author of two books: <i>Jerusalem, Jerusalem</i> and<i>The Heavenly City</i>. He achieved world-wide fame with his publication of Zvi Kalitz's <i>Jossel Rakover's Return to God</i>, which he rediscovered, translated, and edited.</p>The Veil of Manoppello is the sudarium of Christ. This is the mysterious second cloth from the tomb of the crucified Christ that John the Evangelist discovered about 40 hours after the death of Jesus--together with another linen sheet, which is today preserved in Turin. --<br><b>Paul Badde</b><br><br>The Shroud is an Icon written in blood; the blood of a man who was scourged, crowned with thorns, crucified and whose right side was pierced. The Image impressed upon the Shroud is that of a dead man, but the blood speaks of his life. Every trace of blood speaks of love and of life. --<br><b>Pope Benedict XVI</b></p><h2>The Histories, Volume I: Books 1-2 (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>The historian Polybius (ca. 200&#x2013;118 BCE) was born into a leading family of Megalopolis in the Peloponnese (Morea) and served the Achaean League in arms and diplomacy for many years, favoring alliance with Rome. From 168 to 151 he was held hostage in Rome, where he became a friend of Lucius Aemilius Paulus and his two sons, especially Scipio Aemilianus, whose campaigns, including the destruction of Carthage, he later attended. Late in his life he became a trusted mediator between Greece and the Romans; helped in the discussions that preceded the final war with Carthage; and after 146 was entrusted by the Romans with the details of administration in Greece.</p><p>Polybius&#x2019; overall theme is how and why the Romans spread their power as they did. The main part of his history covers the years 264&#x2013;146 BCE, describing the rise of Rome, her destruction of Carthage, and her eventual domination of the Greek world. It is a great work: accurate, thoughtful, largely impartial, based on research, and full of insight into customs, institutions, geography, the causes of events, and the character of peoples. It is a vital achievement of the first importance despite the incomplete state in which all but the first five of its original forty books have reached us.</p><p>For this edition, W. R. Paton&#x2019;s excellent translation, first published in 1922, has been thoroughly revised, the B�ttner-Wobst Greek text corrected, and explanatory notes and a new introduction added, all reflecting the latest scholarship.</p></p><p><p>William Roger Paton (1857&#x2013;1921) was an independent scholar educated at Oxford and based in Samos.</p><p>F. W. Walbank was Rathbone Professor of Ancient History and Classical Archaeology at the University of Liverpool and a Fellow of the British Academy.</p><p>Christian Habicht is Emeritus Professor of Ancient History at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, and a Fellow of the British Academy.</p>&#x201c;Polybius found a brilliant subject for his history in the Roman drive to supremacy in the Mediterranean. As an experienced Greek politician who lived as a hostage among the elite in Rome from 167 to 159 BC, he was ideally positioned to write it. He had formidable organizational powers, and he really did know what he was talking about. Without him, our understanding of the whole period and of the dynamics of Roman imperialism would be inconceivably impoverished.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Denis Feeney</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;These are the first two volumes of a revised text and translation of the <i>Histories</i> of Polybius. Polybius was the Greek historian who wrote of the rise of Rome to Mediterranean power, and who is usually ranked as one of the ancient world's great historians. This edition is based on that of W. R. Paton (1922), which has long served scholars but has been in sore need of updating and correction. This new version comes thanks to Frank W. Walbank (1909-2008), the great Polybius scholar of the modern world, whose monumental three-volume <i>A Historical Commentary on Polybius</i> (1957&#x2013;79) is the starting point for all modern studies of the historian and the era he chronicled. While writing his commentary, Walbank systematically corrected Paton's edition in hundreds of places, and these changes have now been incorporated by Christian Habicht, himself one of the great historians of the Hellenistic age. Habicht has provided a new introduction, bibliography, and notes, and the result is a splendid, reliable, and up-to-date edition of Polybius that will be accessible to students and scholars alike. One looks forward eagerly to the remaining volumes that are to appear over the next year.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J. M.

In these haunting and wickedly funny stories, an apocalypse might come in the form of the end of a relationship or the end of the world, but they all expose the tricky landscape of our longing for a clean slate. In three longer stories, contemporary American life is playfully, if disturbingly, distorted: the rite of passage for adolescent girls involves choosing the madman who will accompany them into adulthood; California burns to the ground while, on the east coast, life carries on; and a soldier returns home broke from war to encounter a witch who extends a dangerous offer.<br><br>At once mournful and explosively energetic, <i>One Hundred Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses</i> is "deeply rooted in the politics and upheaval of our times" (<i>Lambda Literary</i>).</p></p><p><p><b>Lucy Corin</b> is the author of the short story collection <i>The Entire Predicament</i> and the novel <i>Everyday Psychokillers: A History for Girls</i>.

A greedy soldier meets a witch who could be his mother on the road home from war and uncovers jewels in deep holes guarded by giant dogs, high school kids take refuge in a snowy cave while California burns and parents, glued to TV's, sit in bed with trays of cheese sandwiches . Couples, families, brothers, lovers, meth addicts , and drunken zombies cope with what is left after loss. In the short piece "Questions in Significantly Smaller Font" (the title is quite literal, you may need a magnifying glass) Corbin asks: "What will the apocalypse mean for narrative?" The answer may not come so easily, but the craft and language makes the journey quite satisfying. With stories within stories and tiny typeface preceded by two sentence tales, this fulfilling maze, guided by a constant theme, is an eye-opening, enlightening read.&#x201d; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"There is no writer quite like Lucy Corin. Her control over language her unique phrasing feels like an incantation leads the reader willingly toward their own reckoning. What makes Corin such an amazing writer, one of my favorites, is that once she brings you to the end you don't want to leave, because, as she says in one of her apocalypses, 'finally it was all so beautiful.'" Kevin Wilson, author of <i>The Family Fang</i><br><br>"[Corin] leaves us thinking deeply about parts of humanity we don't often examine under a magnifying glass."

Her achievement is already dazzling, he promise immense." Citation of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Rome Prize<br><br>"Corin is one of the few authors who continuously plays with the form of the short story, and the fact that her subject matter is alternate endings to the world (which is the term she uses for these short, morbid vignettes) is amazing." <i>Memorious Mag</i><br><br>"Corin&#x2019;s elliptical style becomes her greatest asset: Strangeness becomes estranging, unsettling." <i>Kirkus</i><br><br>"Corin&#x2019;s newest collection <i>One Hundred Apocalypses and Other Apocalypses</i> (McSweeney&#x2019;s) resists categorization." <i>Lambda Literary</i><br><br>Praise for Lucy Corin:<br><br> Pure sleight of hand.

Susan Salter Reynolds, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br> Fiercely strange and written with keen control. You don't read these stories: you undergo them. They are an event that is lived, not an object that is scanned. Language here is a tangible sensation; Corin's words have weight, temperature, odor, texture, bite. Vision and noise invade you. You become anxious. Then you may find yourself pinching your nose, squeezing your eyes, so as not to let this world escape your body.&#x201d; Micaela Morrissette, <i>Rain Taxi</i><br><br> If prudence allowed, I would populate this review with nothing but passages from Lucy Corin's mesmerizing collection of stories, <i>The Entire Predicament</i>.

At the same time, the United States emerged as the world&#x2019;s largest industrial economy, and creatures like <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, <i>Brontosaurus</i>, and <i>Triceratops</i> became emblems of American capitalism. Large, fierce, and spectacular, American dinosaurs dominated the popular imagination, making front-page headlines and appearing in feature films.</p><p><i>Assembling the Dinosaur</i> follows dinosaur fossils from the field to the museum and into the commercial culture of North America&#x2019;s Gilded Age. Business tycoons like Andrew Carnegie and J. P. Morgan made common cause with vertebrate paleontologists to capitalize on the widespread appeal of dinosaurs, using them to project American exceptionalism back into prehistory. Learning from the show-stopping techniques of P. T. Barnum, museums exhibited dinosaurs to attract, entertain, and educate the public. By assembling the skeletons of dinosaurs into eye-catching displays, wealthy industrialists sought to cement their own reputations as generous benefactors of science, showing that modern capitalism could produce public goods in addition to profits. Behind the scenes, museums adopted corporate management practices to control the movement of dinosaur bones, restricting their circulation to influence their meaning and value in popular culture.</p><p>Tracing the entwined relationship of dinosaurs, capitalism, and culture during the Gilded Age, Lukas Rieppel reveals the outsized role these giant reptiles played during one of the most consequential periods in American history.</p></p><p>Lukas Rieppel is the David and Michelle Ebersman Assistant Professor of History at Brown University. He has held fellowships from the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University, the Science in Human Culture Program at Northwestern University, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&#x201c;A brilliant, original history of dinosaurs set within the landscape of American science, capitalism, and culture. Rieppel integrates the practices and ambitions of vertebrate paleontologists, the patronage they found among wealthy industrialists, and the public&#x2019;s fascination with these colossal creatures from the deep past&#x2015;from the discovery of fossil remains in the American West at the turn of the twentieth century through their assembly in emergent museums of natural history.

These hulking creatures, expensive to excavate and to display, became a perfect match for the self-presentation of the rising economic elite in the United States. Connecting the history of capitalism and the history of science, this important book traces how the shifting presentation of these fossils&#x2015;from massive, slow moving, and solitary to agile and social&#x2015;mirrored the transition from giant corporations to nimble startups.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sven Beckert, author of <i>Empire of Cotton: A Global History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Resting on broad erudition and an expansive historical imagination, <i>Assembling the Dinosaur</i> explores the relationship of science, culture, and economy in the Gilded Age.

It recreates on the tabletop the tension and excitement of modern action-thrillers such as the Bond and Bourne films, The Unit or Burn Notice TV shows, and the Splinter Cell and Modern Warfare series of video games.</p><p>The fast-play rules use regular 6-sided dice and a card-driven activation system to keep all players in the thick of the action, while the mission generator provides a wide range of options for scenarios, from stealthy extraction or surveillance missions to more overt raids or assassinations. Stealth, combat and technical expertise all have a role to play, and players may select from a number of different character types - spies, mercenaries, criminals, hackers, special forces and many more - to recruit the best possible team for the job. Players may also choose to join a faction - powerful organizations, intelligence agencies, criminal syndicates, militaries or rebel groups, each with a stake in international affairs.

Are they parasites? Can any of them really live on air? How many kinds live in Florida? Are the pretty ones easy to grow in my garden? This is the first book on Florida's bromeliads and will appeal to both scientists and general readers interested in the state and its unique flora.<br><br>Sixteen of the world's 3400 kinds of bromeliads are found in Florida, along with two natural hybrids. These so-called "air plants" thrive on trees and shrubs as epiphytes, which means they have no roots in soil. They are not parasites, as they use their woody hosts only for mechanical support. Spanish moss and ball moss are found in great numbers throughout the state (and farther north). Most of the rest prefer the warmer climate of the peninsula, many in the cypress swamp forests of south Florida, where they occur so abundantly. This long-awaited book introduces them all, with means of identification, characteristics, distribution maps, and color photographs.</p><p>David H.

The tea industry's economic crisis and Sri Lanka's twenty-six year long civil war have ushered in changes to life and work on the plantations, where family members now migrate from plucking tea to performing domestic work in the capital city of Colombo or farther afield in the Middle East. Using feminist ethnographic methods in research that spans the transitional time between 2008 and 2017, Mythri Jegathesan presents the lived experience of these women and men working in agricultural, migrant, and intimate labor sectors.<br><br>In Tea and Solidarity, Jegathesan seeks to expand anthropological understandings of dispossession, drawing attention to the political significance of gender as a key feature in investment and place making in Sri Lanka specifically, and South Asia more broadly. This vivid and engaging ethnography sheds light on an otherwise marginalized and often invisible minority whose labor and collective heritage of dispossession as "coolies" in colonial Ceylon are central to Sri Lanka's global recognition, economic growth, and history as a postcolonial nation.</p><p>Mythri Jegathesan is assistant professor of anthropology at Santa Clara University."Examines the lives of women residing (and often working) on tea plantations in Sri Lanka's central highlands, with emphasis on how the prevailing cultural norms and labor relations limit and disempower them."&#x2015;Michele Gamburd, author of <i>The Golden Wave: Culture and Politics after Sri Lanka's Tsunami Disaster</i><p>"Using compelling stories, impressive fieldwork, and thorough archival research, Mythri Jegathesan explores the desires of contemporary plantation workers and their efforts to pursue social and economic dignity."&#x2015;Caitrin Lynch, author of<i> Juki Girls, Good Girls: Gender and Cultural Politics in Sri Lanka's Global Garment Industry</i></p><p>"Beautiful, brutal, powerful and poignant, <i>Tea and Solidarity</i> must be read by anyone who is concerned with the contemporary conditions of quotidian slow violence.

As librarian at the Washington County Free Library in Maryland, Titcomb&nbsp;was concerned that the library was not reaching all the people it could. She was determined that <i>everyone</i> should have access to the library&#x2014;not just adults and those who lived in town. Realizing its limitations and inability&nbsp;to reach the county&#x2019;s 25,000 rural residents, including farmers and their families, Titcomb set about to change the library system forever with the introduction of book-deposit stations throughout the country,&nbsp;a children&#x2019;s room in the library, and her most revolutionary idea of all&#x2014;a horse-drawn Book Wagon.&nbsp;Soon book wagons were appearing in other parts of the country, and by 1922, the book wagon idea had received widespread support.&nbsp;The bookmobile was born!</p><p><b>Sharlee Glenn</b> has published articles, essays, poems, and short stories for adults and children.

For centuries this promise has been sidelined or misunderstood because of the church&#39;s failure to grasp the full meaning of biblical teachings on creation and new creation. The Bible tells the story of the broken and restored relationship between God, people, and land, not just God and people. This is the full gospel, and it has the power to heal the church&#39;s long theological divorce between earth and heaven. Jesus&#39; resurrection in the power of the Holy Spirit is the key, and the church as Christ&#39;s body is the primary means by which God is reconciling all things through Jesus Christ. Jesus&#39; ultimate healing of all creation is the great hope and promise of the gospel, and he calls the church to be his healing community now through evangelism, discipleship, and prophetic mission.</p><p>Howard A.

He holds a Ph.D. from Drew University, where he worked closely with Thomas Oden in the development of the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture (I.V.P.)."This book clearly reveals that Snyder's conjunctive theology is congruent with East Asian ways of thinking. The scope of soteriology in his numerous books has been from creation to new creation. This book, however, is exceptionally thorough. It really does reconceive the whole meaning of salvation in a more soundly biblical way."<br>--Ohoon Kwon <br>Mokwon University<br><br>"In Salvation Means Creation Healed, Howard and Joel speak prophetic truth for Christ's Church, which continues to be deceived by the sirens of Platonic idealism that separate matter and spirit into two different worlds. God is redeeming Creation. A must read!"<br>--Mike Slaughter<br>Ginghamsburg Church<br><br>"Salvation Means Creation Healed crafts a stunning vision of the breadth of God's Reign in Jesus Christ over all things in both heaven and earth and then invites the church to participate fully. It is compelling. It is challenging. It demands a response."<br>--David Fitch<br>author of The End of Evangelicalism?<br><br>"In an era of dramatic and irreversible destruction of the earth's resources, Salvation Means Creation Healed is a timely call for Christians to recover a biblical vision of the missio dei as the restoration of all creation. We all need to heed this call toward a fullness of the gospel, pledging ourselves to reconcile the unfortunate divorce between heaven and earth. Our grandchildren's future is at stake."<br>--Cheryl Bridges Johns<br>Church of God Seminary<br><br>Snyder continues to burst old wineskins with Salvation Means Creation Healed. This is an important biblical, theological and historical examination of how modern evangelicalism has lost its way with regard to creation care and the gospel.

Luckily, the most sought-after lady in the city has agreed to usher this young, lovely country girl through the perils and pitfalls of her all-important first season.</p><p>Dashing highlander Duncan MacTavish is even less keen to be in London. Having recently learned he is the sole heir of an English marquis, Duncan is now required to assume his grandfather's title and estates&#x2014;and to marry Sabrina's ravishing, viper-tongued guide, who has been heard to make scathing statements in public about her "Scottish barbarian" groom-to-be.</p><p>His unwanted betrothal, however, has brought Duncan into close proximity with the enchanting Sabrina&#x2014;a kindred spirit whose wit delights him . . . and whose essence is the exquisite stuff of dreams.

This is only the first in a series of unwelcome surprises for the brawny Scot, who was perfectly content to take over as laird of the clan MacTavish. Saddled with a fianc�e he doesn't like, Ophelia, whose beauty is surpassed only by her waspish nature; far from the home and life he loves; and being pressured by the autocratic Marquis of Birmingdale to toe the line of English respectability, Duncan meets the Honorable Sabrina Lambert and finds her a breath of fresh air in the stifling atmosphere of the English house party. </p><p> Unfortunately, scandalous rumors taint Sabrina's family name, practically ensuring that she will never be able to secure an advantageous match.

Today, there is a real possibility that the destitute North Korean regime will soon dominate its thriving southern neighbor, with help from the government in Seoul itself.<br><br> More than any South Korean president before him, Moon Jae-in is intent on achieving Korean union, even if it&#x2019;s done on Pyongyang&#x2019;s terms.

We work for the casino. Exactly who profits from you sitting here alone for another ten hours?&#x201d; She pointed. &#x201c;Go home.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a&#x2014;&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then eat something. But go.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kal&#x2019;s throat went dry as he saw Minn&#x2019;s hands move toward the undealt cards, ready to dispose of the decks. <i>Please, don&#x2019;t&#x2014; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oooh, it&#x2019;s zinbiddle!&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Kal turned to see a diminutive reptilian in a formal black coat, accentuated with a dazzling stellabora lapel bloom. The green-skinned creature flashed a smile so broad it nearly bisected his face as he dropped a fat tray of coins onto the tabletop to Kal&#x2019;s right. &#x201c;Deal me in,&#x201d; he said, hopping up into the chair beside Kal. <br> &nbsp;<br> Kal stared at the ebullient arrival, mystified, before looking to the dealer, who suspended her cleanup. He told Vestry, &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m in luck.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The pit boss stared silently at the players. Kal could swear he saw her mouth form the words, <i>That&#x2019;s what you think. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was at the yacht races,&#x201d; the newcomer said. &#x201c;Were you at the yacht races?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You should have been at the yacht races.&#x201d; He offered a chubby green hand. &#x201c;Dodibin. Dodi for short&#x2014;but don&#x2019;t call me that.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call you Dodi?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call me short.&#x201d; He looked stern for a moment&#x2014;and then laughed. &#x201c;And you are Kaljach.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Lucky guess, </i>he began to say, before remembering his badge. &#x201c;Kal is fine.&#x201d; He watched as the Suerton&#x2014;the species he thought Dodi was&#x2014;unloaded his chips. Then Dodi pushed a large stack onto the instant-win marker, a side bet the casino covered from its rake. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a long shot,&#x201d; Kal said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Excellent.&#x201d; Chipper, Dodi rocked back and forth in his chair as Minn started dealing. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was no skin off Kal&#x2019;s nonexistent nose; the side bet was against the house, not him. Though he would have loved to cover it, because there was no greater joy than taking money off someone too stupid to&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Zinbiddle!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kal gawked. &#x201c;You got it?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dodi flipped up his cards, all in the proper suit and sequence. &#x201c;Dealt pat.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Kal hadn&#x2019;t even looked at his cards yet. He quickly did, and took note of what Dodi had shown, before Minn recovered them all. That was the risk in riding &#x201c;final station,&#x201d; the seat on the dealer&#x2019;s right; Kal saw more cards that way, but occasionally an instant winner would cut a hand short. Fortunately, the odds said that wouldn&#x2019;t happen very&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Zinbiddle,&#x201d; Dodi chirped. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s still dealing the hand!&#x201d; Kal spouted. Calling early was a dumb move, disqualifying if the hand wasn&#x2019;t as declared. <i>Unless the fool actually had it? </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, what do you know?&#x201d; Dodi said, overturning his four cards as soon as they&#x2019;d landed. &#x201c;I had a feeling.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d left his winnings from before on the instant-win marker; he&#x2019;d won again. Minn went to work exchanging Dodi&#x2019;s coins for higher-denomination ones. <br> &nbsp;<br> And now, Kal saw, Vestry was back, keeping a discreet watch from behind Minn. She knew everything, or so she put on. What did she know about this guy? <br> &nbsp;<br> The good news was Kal was only out two initial stakes, and the decks, if anything, had swung even more into his favor. If a hand ever lasted long enough for him to play, he could start building out his pyramid in pursuit of the progressive. But he was beginning to wonder what he was up against&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;and wondered some more when he heard a voice like Dodi&#x2019;s, only lower-pitched, from behind. <i>&#x201c;There you are!&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Kal turned to see another Suerton, looking much like Dodi apart from a few extra centimeters&#x2019; height, more pronounced ears, and a necklace of silver ringlets. &#x201c;Thodi!&#x201d; Dodi said, hopping off his chair. &#x201c;Kal, meet Thodi, my brother.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the smart one,&#x201d; Thodi said, and smiled. &#x201c;At your service.&#x201d; He glanced at Dodi&#x2019;s stack on the table. &#x201c;What are we doing?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Winning,&#x201d; Kal said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, I know <i>that.</i>&#x201d; Thodi pushed Dodi. &#x201c;Step aside for the master, my good chump.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Dodi resisted. &#x201c;I was doing fine on my own.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I doubt that.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Minn was befuddled. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s playing, gentlebeings?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was hatched first,&#x201d; Thodi said. &#x201c;Ten seconds earlier. Mom said.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Dodi smirked at Kal. &#x201c;He always gets me with that.&#x201d; The slightly younger brother withdrew, and Thodi climbed into the chair. He looked down at Dodi&#x2019;s winnings. &#x201c;Oh, now, see, you&#x2019;re making these silly blind bets again.&#x201d; He pulled the stacks of coins back from the table and began to sort them. &#x201c;What you need to do is add up the values of your cards, and bet that. If the number is even, double it. And if it&#x2019;s prime, you bet your age.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Wow, </i>Kal thought. <i>That is completely wrong. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Thodi,&#x201d; Dodi said, &#x201c;that is completely wrong.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just a gambler,&#x201d; the elder Suerton said. &#x201c;Me&#x2014;I&#x2019;m a <i>gamer. </i>Watch.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thodi played the hand his way&#x2014;and, in the end, was completely wrong. Kal won some coins, but not many. <i>He must not be that old, </i>Kal thought. But he could live with it. The green guys&#x2019; fortunes seemed to dim as the brothers bickered&#x2014;and that meant the hands lasted longer, giving Kal more data about the decks with every card. And the Ion Barrage chance was ever closer. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>This is it! </i>Kal fought to stay calm. <i>Forget the brothers. </i>This was him against fate, months and months of it. This hand, he&#x2019;d be all in, buying extra draws as necessary to build his pyramid. And then all his problems would be&#x2014; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hi ho!&#x201d; shouted someone in the aisle.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Wodi!&#x201d; </i>the brothers replied in unison. &#x201c;Over here!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What now?&#x201d; Kal said. He shot an anguished look at Vestry, whose steely reserve had yet to crack. Her eyes were on the aisle, where a Suerton with a bounding gait approached&#x2014;and then receded, in pursuit of a droid carrying liquid refreshments. <br> &nbsp;<br> Dodi poked Kal in the ribs. &#x201c;Wodi, my kid brother. You&#x2019;ll like him, Kal. Dad used to call him the kind of guy who&#x2019;d fly all the way to Alderaan if he heard a party was starting.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t Alderaan blow up?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, Wodi wasn&#x2019;t responsible.&#x201d; Dodi pursed his giant lips as Wodi, having scored a tray of beverages, let out a loud whoop. &#x201c;At least, I don&#x2019;t think he was. When did it happen?&#x201d;</p><h2>The Legend of Cessna</h2><p>In the last 95 years, rapid advances in aviation technology have fundamentally changed the way we live, work, and wage war, and the Cessna Aircraft Company has helped forge the way.

Seven weeks later, the girl is stabbed to death on Emanuel&#39;s couch--with incriminating fingerprints on the murder weapon.

At any rate, a student<br>asked me to recommend a psychoanalyst, and I gave her your name and<br>address. I have no idea if she'll call, but I rather expect she will. Her<br>name is Janet Harrison." Kate walked to the window and looked out on the<br>raw and blustery weather. It was the sort of January day when even she,<br>who loathed spring, longed for it.<br><br>"Considering your opinion of psychiatry," Nicola said, "Emanuel should<br>feel duly honored. Look honored, Emanuel!" Nicola, Emanuel's wife,<br>followed these discussions rather as the spectator at a tennis match<br>follows the ball, her head turning from one to the other. Having managed<br>to place her faith in psychiatry without withdrawing her right to<br>criticize, she applauded the good shots and groaned at the misses. Kate<br>and Emanuel, charmed with Nicola as audience, enjoyed the matches not only<br>for the occasional insights which emerged from them, but also because they<br>shared the knack of irritating without ever offending each other. Nicola<br>smiled on them both.<br><br>"It isn't Freud himself one quarrels with," Kate said, "nor even the great<br>body of theory he evolved. It's the dissemination of his ideas in the<br>modern world. I'm always reminded of the story of the Japanese gentleman<br>and the Trinity: 'Honorable Father, very good; Honorable Son, very good;<br>but Honorable Bird I do not understand at all.' "<br><br>"Your quotations," Emanuel said, "always enliven the conversation without<br>in any way advancing the discussion."<br><br>"The only quotation I can think of," said Nicola, in her turn walking to<br>the window, "is 'If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?' "<br><br>Which, as it turned out, was the most significant remark anybody made that<br>afternoon.<br><br><b>One</b><br><br>Someone had chalked "April is the cruelest month" on the steps of Baldwin<br>Hall. Kate, unimpressed by the erudition, agreed with the sentiment.<br>Spring on an Ameri-<br>can campus, even as urban a campus as this one, inevitably drove the<br>faculty into a mood compounded of lassitude, irritation, and<br>fastidiousness. Perhaps, Kate thought, it is because we are getting old,<br>while the students, like Caesar's crowds on the Appian Way, are always the<br>same age. Gazing at the students who sprawled, or made love, on every<br>available patch of grass, Kate longed, as she did each spring, for a<br>statelier, less untidy era. "The young in one another's arms," Yeats had<br>complained.<br><br>She mentioned this to Professor Anderson, who had stopped too, pondering<br>the chalk inscription. "This time of year," he said, "I always want to<br>shut myself up in a dark room, with the curtains drawn, and play Bach.<br>Really, you know," he said, still regarding Eliot's line, "Millay put it<br>better: 'To what purpose, April, do you return again?' " <br><br>Kate was startled<br>by Professor Anderson, who was an eighteenth-century man with a strong<br>distaste for all female writers since Jane Austen. Together they entered<br>the building and mounted the stairs to the English department on the next<br>floor. That was it, really. However expected, April was always startling.<br>On the bench outside Kate's office, waiting for her office hours, sat a<br>line of students. This too was a spring symptom. The good students either<br>vanished from the campus altogether, or appeared at odd moments to argue<br>some abstruse point of interpretation. The mediocre, particularly the poor<br>ones, began to worry about marks. April, stirring their dull senses,<br>reminded them that the time of marks was near and the B they had<br>faithfully promised themselves dismally remote. They had come to talk it<br>out. Kate sighed as she unlocked the door to her office, and then stopped,<br>in surprise and annoyance. A man standing at the window turned as she<br>entered.<br><br>"Please come in, Miss Fansler. Perhaps I should say Doctor, or Professor;<br>I am Acting Captain Stern, Detective from the Police Department. I've<br>shown my credentials to the secretary in the office, who suggested that I<br>had perhaps better wait in here. She was kind enough to let me in. I<br>haven't disturbed anything. Won't you sit down?"<br><br>"I assure you, Captain," Kate said, sitting down at her desk, "I know very<br>little about the personal lives of my students. Has one of them got into<br>trouble?" She regarded the detective with interest. An avid reader of<br>detective stories, she had always suspected that in real life detectives<br>were desperately ordinary men, the sort who coped well with short-answer<br>exams (corrected by machine) but were annoyed by complex ideas, literary<br>or otherwise; the sort who liked the hardness of facts and found the need<br>for ambivalence distasteful.<br><br>"Would you be good enough to tell me, Miss Fansler, what you were doing<br>yesterday morning until noon?"<br><br>"What I was doing? Really, Captain Stern, I do assure you that . . ."<br><br>"If you will just be good enough to answer my questions, Miss Fansler, I<br>will explain the reasons for them very shortly. Yesterday morning?"<br><br>Kate stared at him, and then shrugged. As is the unfortunate habit of the<br>literary person, she already imagined herself retelling this extraordinary<br>event. She caught the detective's eye, and reached for a cigarette. He lit<br>it for her, waiting patiently. "I don't teach on Tuesdays," she said. "I<br>am writing a book, and I spent all yesterday morning in the stacks of the<br>library, looking up articles in nineteenth-<br>century periodicals. I was there until a little before one, when I went to<br>wash, and then to meet Professor Popper for lunch. We ate in the faculty<br>club."<br><br>"Do you live alone, Miss Fansler?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"What time did you arrive in the 'stacks'?"<br><br>"The stacks, Captain Stern, are the inner floors of the library, on which<br>the books are kept." Why is it, she wondered, that women are always<br>annoyed at being asked if they live alone? "I got to the library at about<br>nine-thirty."<br><br>"Did anyone see you in the stacks?"<br><br>"Anyone who could give me an 'alibi'? No. I found the volumes I wanted,<br>and worked with them at the small tables along the wall provided for that<br>purpose. Several people must have seen me there, but whether they<br>recognized me, or remembered me, I couldn't say."<br><br>"Do you have a student named Janet Harrison?"<br><br>In books, Kate thought, detectives were always enthusiastically interested<br>in their work, rather like knights on <br>a quest. It had never really occurred to her before with what fervor they<br>attacked their work. Some of the time, of course, they were related to, or<br>in love with, the accused or murdered, but whether being a detective was<br>their job or avocation, they seemed vehemently to care. She wondered what,<br>if anything, Acting Captain Stern cared about. Could she ask him if he<br>lived alone? Certainly not. "Janet Harrison? She used to be a student of<br>mine; that is, she took one of my classes, on the nineteenth-century<br>novel. That was last semester; I haven't seen her since." Kate thought<br>longingly of Lord Peter Wimsey; at this point, surely, he would have<br>paused to discuss the nineteenth-century novel. Captain Stern seemed never<br>to have heard of it.<br><br>"Did you recommend that she attend a psychoanalyst?"<br><br>"Good God," Kate said, "is that what this has to do with? Surely the<br>police are not checking up on all people who attend analysts. I didn't<br>'recommend' that she attend an analyst; I would consider it improper to do<br>any such thing. She came to me having already decided, or been advised, to<br>go to an analyst. She asked me if I could recommend a good one, since she<br>had heard of the importance of finding a properly qualified man. Now that<br>you mention it, I don't quite know why she came to me; I suppose we <br>are all too willing to assume that others recognize us as monuments of<br>good sense and natural authorities on most things."<br><br>There was no answering smile from Captain Stern. "Did you in fact<br>recommend a psychoanalyst?"<br><br>"Yes, in fact, I did!"<br><br>"What was the name of the analyst you recommended?"<br><br>Kate was suddenly angry. Glancing out of the window, where April was<br>breeding desire all over the place, did nothing to improve her mood. She<br>averted her eyes from the campus and looked at the detective, who appeared<br>unmoved by April. Undoubtedly he found all months equally cruel. Whatever<br>this was about-and her curiosity had been greatly diluted by annoyance-was<br>there any purpose in dragging Emanuel into it? "Captain Stern," she asked,<br>"am I required to answer that question? I'm not at all certain of the<br>legal rights in this matter, but wouldn't I be 'booked,' or told what this<br>is all about, if I'm to answer questions? Would it suffice for now if I<br>were to assure you (though I cannot prove it) that yesterday morning until <br>one o'clock I was involved in no way whatever with any human being other<br>than Thomas Carlyle, whose death well over half a century ago precludes<br>the possibility of my having been in any way involved in it?"<br><br>Captain Stern ignored this. "You say you did recommend a psychoanalyst to<br>Janet Harrison. Did she find him satisfactory; did she plan to continue<br>with him for very long?"<br><br>"I don't know," Kate said, feeling somewhat ashamed <br>of her outburst into sarcasm, "I don't even know if she went to him. I<br>gave her his name, address, and telephone number. I mentioned the matter<br>to him. From that moment to this I haven't seen the girl, nor given her a<br>moment's thought."<br><br>"Surely the analyst would have mentioned the matter to you, if he had<br>taken her as a patient. Particularly," Captain Stern added, revealing for<br>the first time a certain store of knowledge, "if he were a good friend."<br><br>Kate stared at him. At least, she thought, we are not playing twenty<br>questions. "I can't make you believe it, of course, but he did not mention<br>it, nor would a first-rate analyst do so, particularly if I had not asked<br>him. The man in question is a member of the New York Psychoanalytic<br>Institute, and it is against their principles ever to discuss <br>a patient. This may seem strange; nonetheless, it is the simple truth."<br><br>"What sort of girl was Janet Harrison?"<br><br>Kate leaned back in the chair, trying to gauge the man's intelligence. She<br>had learned as a college teacher that if one simplified what one wished to<br>say, one falsified it. It was possible only to say what one meant, as<br>clearly as possible. What could this Janet Harrison have done? Were they<br>trying to establish her instability? Really, this laconic policeman was<br>most trying.</p><h2>The Stories of the Lotus Sutra</h2><p>Stories are ancient and wondrous tools with the mysterious power to transform lives.

How is it maintained within the contemporary states system? And do desirable and feasible alternatives to the states system exist? Contrary to common claims, Bull asserts that the sovereign states system is not in decline. Rather, it persists and thrives, as it is essential to maintaining an international world order.<br><br>More than three decades after its publication, Bull's classic work continues to define and direct research in international relations. In this thirty-fifth anniversary edition, the text has been updated and includes a new interpretive foreword by the world's leading expert on Bull and his contributions to the theory, structures, and practices of world politics. <i>The Anarchical Society</i> identifies and confronts the unwritten rules supporting the international order across history, despite sweeping changes in laws and institutions. It considers and rejects the idea that the states system is giving way to an alternative world government or some method of neo-medieval rule or that the states system has ceased to be viable or compatible with objectives such as peace, economic justice, and ecological control. Bull also reviews and comments upon a variety of proposals for states system reform.</p><p>Hedley Bull (1932&#x2013;1985) was Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at Oxford University.

Yet many research sites may contain such materials. Without a framework for identifying the bones or the excavation techniques suited to their recovery, archaeologists may often overlook subadult skeletal remains or even confuse them with animal bones.<br><br> <i>The Osteology of Infants and Children</i> fills the need for a field and lab manual on this important topic and provides a supplemental textbook for human osteology courses. Focusing on juvenile skeletons, their recovery and identification, and siding in both field and lab settings, the volume provides basic descriptions and careful illustrations of each skeletal element at varying stages of development, along with sections on differentiation from other bones and siding tips.<br><br> The book offers detailed treatment of the skull and teeth, including the cranial vault and facial bones, and examines the infracranial skeleton: vertebrae, pelvis, chest, shoulders, arms, hands, legs, and feet. A quick reference guide explains age estimation and identification templates. <br><br> The illustrations are enhanced by photographs from two recent archaeology projects in Egypt, at Abydos and Dakhleh Oasis.

Dr. Ross defines the problem of comorbidity as the central conceptual problem in psychiatry, then solves it using the logic and predictions of the Trauma Model. A person with extensive comorbidity suffers from many different psychiatric disorders at the same time. Most individuals requiring inpatient psychiatric treatment fit the profile of the Trauma Model. Dr. Ross also presents a detailed description of Trauma Model therapy, which is suitable for a wide range of addictions, self-destructive behaviors and symptoms. General principles and specific techniques are described and illustrated with dialogue from composite case examples.</p><p>Colin A.

As they do the things we all do-bum a cigarette at a party, stroll with a girlfriend down Madison Avenue, take a kid to the zoo-they're confronted with their own uncooperative selves. These artists, writers, lawyers, teachers, and actors make fools of themselves, spiral out of control, have delusions of grandeur, despair, and find it hard to imagine a future. They talk, they listen, they hope, they dream. They look for communion in a city, both beautiful and menacing, which can promise so much and yield so little. But they are hungry for life. They want to love and be loved.</p><p>These stories, all published in <i>The New Yorker</i> over the last fifteen years, make it clear that Antrim is one of America's most important writers. His work has been praised by his significant contemporaries, including Jonathan Franzen, Thomas Pynchon, Jeffrey Eugenides, and George Saunders, who described <i>The Verificationist</i> as "one of the most pleasure-giving, funny, perverse, complicated, addictive novels of the last twenty years." <i>The Emerald Light in the Air </i>is Antrim's best book yet: the story collection that reveals him as a master of the form.</p></p><p>Donald Antrim is the author of the novels <i>Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World</i>, <i>The Hundred Brothers</i>, and <i>The Verificationist</i>, as well as a memoir, <i>The Afterlife</i>.

He is a 2013 MacArthur Fellow.<p><i>AN ACTOR PREPARES</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Lee Strasberg, a founder of the Group Theatre and the great teacher of the American Method, famously advised his students never to &#x201c;use&#x201d;&#x2014;for generating tears, etc., in a dramatic scene&#x2014;personal/historical material less than seven years in the personal/historical past; otherwise, the Emotion Memory (the death of a loved one or some like event in the actor&#x2019;s life that can, when evoked through recall and substitution, hurl open the floodgates, as they say, right on cue, night after night, even during a long run)&#x2014;this material, being <i>too close</i>, as it were, might overwhelm the artist and compromise the total control required to act the part or, more to the point, act it well; might, in fact, destabilize the play; if, for instance, at the moment in a scene when it becomes necessary for Nina or Gertrude or Macduff to wipe away tears and get on with life; if, at that moment, it becomes impossible for a wailing performer to pull it together; if, in other words, the <i>performer</i> remains trapped in affect long after the <i>character</i> has moved on to dinner or the battlefield&#x2014;when this happens, then you can be sure that delirious theatrical mayhem will follow.</p> <p>What is the point in all this? Strasberg was wrong. Seven years are not enough, a fact I discovered recently during a twilight performance of <i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i>, presented on the college green to commemorate the founding, a hundred and fifty years ago, by the Reverend William Trevor Barry&#x2014;my great-great-grandfather on my father&#x2019;s side&#x2014;of the small liberal-arts institution that bears our family&#x2019;s name and our seal. I am Reginald Barry, Dean of Student Life and Wm. T. Barry Professor of Speech and Drama at Barry College, so naturally it fell to me to direct our commemorative, barefoot production of Shakespeare&#x2019;s great festive comedy. While I was at it, I decided to serve up some ham myself, as Lysander. What would a skinny, balding, unmarried, childless forty-six-year-old Lysander&#x2014;a PhD with hair on his back&#x2014;<i>mean</i> within the context of an otherwise college-age show? I&#x2019;m not sure I can answer that question. Normally, Lysander would be essayed by some good-looking lacrosse goalie waiting his turn to date-rape the beautiful, waifish Mary Victoria Frost, our Hermia, only a sophomore herself and already the finest actress we&#x2019;ve had in my time at Barry, a sure candidate for Yale, or Juilliard if she can ease off the drugs. I might stand in as Egeus or Theseus, or maybe Oberon, King of the Faeries, if I felt up to it. But high-concept casting is a director&#x2019;s prerogative. Two seasons ago, we mounted an all-male, all-nude <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>. People said it increased their appreciation for the radical potentials in Elizabethan drama.</p> <p>And so, the play. Four adolescents turned out by law and their parents into a green world governed by spooks, all playing&#x2014;children and their phantoms&#x2014;at love and nighttime evil.</p> <p>The adolescents were me, Mary Victoria Frost, Sheila Tannenbaum, as Helena, and Billy Valentine, as Demetrius. Sheila, a junior, plays character parts when she&#x2019;s not playing basketball for the Lady Bears, and I knew she&#x2019;d make an acceptable if not entirely agreeable Helena, with her big hands and lurching walk and brown eyes too far apart on an otherwise bent-looking, asymmetrical face; but Valentine represented a casting risk. Valentine is a certain kind of blond-haired, upper-middle-class boy&#x2014;the type is familiar at any private school in the land, I would imagine&#x2014;a sarcastic, wiry little underachiever who, on the basis of no evidence, is rumored among his peers to be a genius.</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come to rehearsals stoned, Billy,&#x201d; I warned this kid before first read-through.</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Stoned</i>, Mr. Barry?&#x201d; He laughed. The previous Friday, a bunch of us had found ourselves lying around on sofas in my office in Lower Hancock, getting wasted on some of Billy&#x2019;s very strong homegrown.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here to work,&#x201d; I told him now, and he said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think I should be playing Puck?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You want to direct this show, Valentine?&#x201d; I asked him. &#x201c;No? Then let me worry about casting.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, Mr. Barry. Everything&#x2019;s cool. It&#x2019;s just that Martin can&#x2019;t read his script. I mean, he can&#x2019;t <i>see</i>.&#x201d;</p> <p>Billy Valentine had a point. Putting Martin Epps in as Puck was like putting, well, I don&#x2019;t know what into what. How can you defend a totally blind Robin Goodfellow tapping his way around the stage with a telescoping cane, except in theory?</p> <p>Dramaturgically speaking, the theory was sound enough, I thought; and so I opened up rehearsals by reciting it&#x2014;in somewhat oblique form&#x2014;to my cast. There they were, the &#x201c;drama mafia,&#x201d; down in the windowless Hancock Hall basement, twenty-five or thirty hungover Lovers, Royals, Spirit Wraiths, Merry Men, stagehands, set techies, and walk-ons, all dressed in late-spring cutoffs and oxford-cloth shirts and sheer halter tops, almost every one of this lot&#x2014;except Martin Epps, the blind boy&#x2014;inhaling drags off cigarettes; it was a bored, blas�-looking crowd. &#x201c;Genuine vision, expressed artistically by Shakespeare in the character Puck, is more than the ability to open your eyes, take a look around, and see what&#x2019;s wrong with your life,&#x201d; I announced to these oversexed dope addicts.</p> <p>No one spoke or even looked up, and I had that terrible feeling I get at the kickoff to any rehearsal period, when I realize how much disappointment lies ahead. I said, &#x201c;Well, anyway, Theseus, it&#x2019;s your line to start the play.&#x201d;</p> <p>Still no one spoke. &#x201c;Danielle, do you have the cast list?&#x201d; I asked my sophomore stage manager.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hang on, Mr. Barry, it&#x2019;s here somewhere.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Call me Reg,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;During the play, we&#x2019;re all equals.&#x201d;</p> <p>She stared at me like she wasn&#x2019;t quite sure. Unorthodox etiquette is often perplexing for the young. She held up the cast list and waved it&#x2014;apparently some kind of &#x201c;theatrical&#x201d; gesture&#x2014;in the air over her head. &#x201c;Greg Lippincott, you&#x2019;re Theseus.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, is that how &#x2018;Theseus&#x2019; is pronounced?&#x201d; Greg asked. It was hard to believe he was one of the Philadelphia Lippincotts. He took a puff from his cigarette. Snickering could be heard. It took four hours to complete the read-through. Danielle delivered Martin Epps&#x2019;s lines to him, and Martin repeated each back, painstakingly, one word then the next, like a spy being briefed on a plan.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes,&#x201d; recited Danielle.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll. Put. A girdle. Round about the earth. In forty minutes,&#x201d; said Martin.</p> <p>I made a note to ask him to pick up the pace and not tap cadences on the floor with his cane. I made another note, to Jim Ferguson, warning him to avoid inserting &#x201c;like&#x201d; into Oberon&#x2019;s speeches to Titania. I worried about telling the faeries and goblins that their costumes would consist of G-strings and pasties.</p> <p>I can always give thanks, in these delicate situations, for our costumer, my girlfriend, Carol.</p> <p>Carol came in later in the week, during our first walk-through rehearsal, and made the case for her skimpy outfits.</p> <p>&#x201c;I think we will be able to see from their attire that these faeries are playful and very dangerous, earthy yet devilish, with a heightened insistence on gender that not only subverts our own male-dominated culture but underscores the young lovers&#x2019; cruelty toward one another in the Athenian grove,&#x201d; she announced while staring straight at me. Was it necessary for Carol to see <i>everything</i> as a reflection of the sexual antagonisms in our on-again, off-again relationship?</p> <p>She held the faerie sketches&#x2014;Cobweb, Peaseblossom, Moth, and Mustardseed&#x2014;up in glaring overhead light. A girl wearing shorts and a T-shirt objected: &#x201c;No way. I&#x2019;m not going out there naked.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;This is the theater, honey. The character is naked, not you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Good point, Carol,&#x201d; I interjected, unwisely. Carol gave me one of her furious looks, reminding me that she was approaching a breaking point in our love affair. What can be said about this? After five years, it&#x2019;s a regular enough occurrence. The truth is that we&#x2019;ve never been very happy together. We pick at each other and have squalid fights. I&#x2019;ll spare the details, except to say that whenever I think about our fighting, or about Carol&#x2019;s drinking, I feel sad for us both; and this makes me want to phone her up and find out if she&#x2019;s doing all right; and <i>this</i> behavior, as will easily be understood by anyone who has lasted even a short while in a hostile erotic relationship, is almost invariably a prelude to knockout sex.</p> <p>&#x201c;What will <i>I</i> be wearing&#x201d; called a boy from the back of the basement. The boy was Sam English, a theater regular, bearded and deep-voiced; he was my Bottom. Carol said to him and to the entire cast, &#x201c;Costumes are designed to suggest historical period and class, while also referring to modern dress. Bottom and his fellow Mechanicals will wear weight-lifting belts over wool tunics with the characters&#x2019; names ironed on.&#x201d;</p> <p>It had been my idea to depict Shakespeare&#x2019;s vulgar tradesmen as a team of Elizabethan power lifters. I imagined them carrying six-packs of beer hanging from clear plastic rings. &#x201c;Let me see Bottom and his men at the front of the room, pronto,&#x201d; I called out, to begin that day&#x2019;s walk-through of the play within the play, act five&#x2019;s irresistible &#x201c;tedious brief scene of young Pyramus and his love Thisbe.&#x201d;</p> <p>Here came Quince, the carpenter; Bottom, the weaver; Flute, the bellows-mender; Snout, the tinker; Snug, the joiner; and Starveling, the tailor&#x2014;in reality a cluster of political-science and religious-studies majors. These six huddled around me, and I said, &#x201c;You guys are fuckups and you&#x2019;re ugly. You&#x2019;re a bunch of functionally illiterate dipsomaniacs, and I&#x2019;d be amazed if any of you has ever been laid. Your own mothers ought to be ashamed of you.&#x201d;</p> <p>The boys looked confused, and I knew I had them where I wanted them. It is useful, when directing, to blur the boundaries between actor and role, to inaugurate, with a few stringent words, if necessary, a certain emotional instability; in this instance I was exploiting my students&#x2019; routine insecurities in order to lead them to identify with Shakespeare&#x2019;s motley artisans.</p> <p>I then gave these Merry Men my cautionary talk about the hardships of a life in the theater. At some point, I became aware of Danielle&#x2014;I could see her over Sam English&#x2019;s big head; she was waving and pointing at her watch, making those gestures and absurd faces people make when they need your attention, yet are afraid of you&#x2014;so I concluded, &#x201c;Boys, the point is this. People think the theater is romantic and magical. And sometimes it is. But most of the time it&#x2019;s just a pile of crap that nobody cares about.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Time for animal improvisations!&#x201d; Danielle shouted.</p> <p><i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i>, historians tell us, was probably first presented at a royal wedding held in the summer at a house outside London. Presumably, the guests, like wedding guests throughout history, became intoxicated with alcohol and the aphrodisiacal spirit of the occasion. Young couples, wandering in and out of doors, slipping away to flirt or break up or make love, had dramatic counterparts in the unhappy children lost in love in Shakespeare&#x2019;s imaginary grove. How many real lovers woke after the ceremony, hungover and sick, to discover themselves entwined on the lawn with mates met only during the festivities the night before? I wanted to create a world where love is mercurial, unbridled, bestial. In our production of <i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i>, the unmarried lovers would fall asleep after chasing one another through the forest; then, doused with nectar from Puck&#x2019;s flower, they would roll over, rub their eyes, and fuck the wrong person.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all get down on our hands and knees,&#x201d; I told the cast.</p> <p>Down we went. Right away I noticed that Mary Victoria Frost and several faeries appeared to be acting like house cats; these girls arched their backs, projected feline butts into the air, and hissed. Sheila Tannenbaum&#x2014;who, in act two, scene one, repeats the famous line &#x201c;Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me&#x201d;&#x2014;was doing a nice job as a submissive pup, rolling over and sticking out her tongue to lick Billy Valentine, slithering past on his belly. Lion roared and Bottom brayed like an ass, and Sarah Goldwasser, our Titania, responded by rubbing herself against Sam; it was clear that these two had a flirtation in the works. That&#x2019;s something I like to see. Sex makes any show better. &#x201c;Oink, oink,&#x201d; I said to Mary Victoria Frost.</p> <p>I love the theater. I really do. And I adored my cast. They adored one another, too; these boys and girls were becoming&#x2014;as the days became weeks and the play took its shape&#x2014;uninhibitedly smitten with one another. It was mid-May, and summer&#x2019;s first warmth was in the air. The basement felt stuffy and hot, thanks to the overheating furnace in the corner.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not out of the woods yet,&#x201d; I announced at the beginning of our third week. &#x201c;Those of you who haven&#x2019;t got off book, you&#x2019;re holding the rest of us up. Demetrius, time your entrances so you don&#x2019;t keep Helena waiting downstage. Titania, less kissing and more teasing when you&#x2019;re giving it up to Bottom in act four. Make him work for it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Reg?&#x201d; peeped a voice from the crowd. It was Sarah Goldwasser, the prima donna.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, Sarah?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;When will we get out of this gross basement and start rehearsing on the green?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Any day now. Roger and Emil are building the platforms in the trees, and they have to dig the hole for Puck. Once Puck&#x2019;s crater is finished, we&#x2019;ll move the show outdoors.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Crater?&#x201d; This from Martin Epps.</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. In our <i>Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i>, the demons won&#x2019;t merely buzz around like woodland pixies; they&#x2019;ll come right up from the earth to grab us and pull us down to Hell. At any rate, Martin, I don&#x2019;t think your hole will be much of a problem after one or two on-site rehearsals. You&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; I assured the blind boy.</p> <p>It was one of those moments when a person (myself, in this instance) says something wholly untoward, and then, becoming aware of the faux pas and its implications, rushes blindly forward&#x2014;there is no other way to describe this adequately, except as a king of verbal blindness&#x2014;exclaiming additional horrors. &#x201c;What I meant is&nbsp;&#x2026; the rest of us will&nbsp;&#x2026; watch you crawling&nbsp;&#x2026; covered with dirt and sticks&nbsp;&#x2026; You can picture it&nbsp;&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t mean literally&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay, Mr. Barry,&#x201d; said Martin Epps.</p> <p>&#x201c;Call me Reg,&#x201d; I reminded him, by way of apology. Then, addressing the room at large, attempting to regain authority: &#x201c;All right. Let me have all the young lovers over in the corner. Lovers, don&#x2019;t touch the boiler.&#x201d;</p> <p>Possibly&#x2014;I should say probably&#x2014;it was risky of me to attempt simulated sex with undergraduates.</p> <p>&#x201c;What do you think, gang? Is this something you feel you can comfortably do in front of an audience?&#x201d;</p> <p>Together we sat&#x2014;Mary Victoria Frost, Sheila Tannenbaum, Billy Valentine, and I&#x2014;in a cozy circle on the floor. Billy, I noticed, had his eye on Mary; he leaned back beside her, and you could tell he was angling to spy an opening in her blouse and glimpse a breast. Mary spoke: &#x201c;How dark will it be?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fairly. By act three, the sun will be setting. With any luck, it&#x2019;ll be a humid night and the fireflies will be out.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be beautiful!&#x201d; exclaimed Sheila.</p> <p>I concurred, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Sheila. When you make love, you&#x2019;re doing God&#x2019;s work on Earth.&#x201d;</p> <p>After that, we sat for a time. The atmosphere became pleasantly uncomfortable. This sensation of a pervasive, shared emotional discomfort may have been helped along by the presence nearby of the foul-smelling oil furnace, hissing and burning, ...</p></p><h2>More Secret Stories of Walt Disney World: More Things You Never Knew You Never Knew</h2><p><p><b>Oh, You Didn't Know...</b></p><p>Just when you think you <i>do</i> know everything there is to know about Walt Disney World, here comes Jim Korkis with a new book full of stuff you won't easily find anywhere else.

How can pastors thrive amid such demands? What is needed is a contemporary pastoral rule: a pattern for ministry that both encourages pastors and enables them to focus on what is most important in their pastoral task. This book, coauthored by three experts with decades of practical experience, explains how relying on a pastoral rule has benefited communities throughout the church's history and how such rules have functioned in the lives and work of figures such as Augustine, Calvin, Wesley, and Bonhoeffer. It also provides concrete advice on how pastors can develop and keep a rule that will help both them and their congregations to flourish.</p><p>John P.

He is the author of several books, including <em>To Be Reformed: Living the Tradition</em>, <em>Proclaiming the Great Ends of the Church</em>, <em>Conversations With the Confessions</em>, and <em>God and Ourselves: A Brief Exercise in Reformed Theology</em>."This book will be especially welcomed by busy pastors who can take time to look back toward the past as well as ahead to the future. What they will find is encouragement of the very best sort from historical exemplars who, though facing great challenges, embodied biblical insight, found Christian stability, and carried out unusually effective ministries. The book is a treasure that gives much-needed dignity and hope to the pastoral calling today." (Mark Noll, author of The Rise of Evangelicalism)<br><br>"If pastors don't set the rule for their lives, everyone else is going to do it for them. This book invites the pastor back to the deep well of our tradition that offers profound insights for thriving in contemporary ministry. Ironically, it's the chosen rule that leads to freedom." (M. Craig Barnes, president, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Rather than lament the well-documented and much-discussed crisis of spirituality in western Christendom, especially among pastoral leaders, Burgess, Andrews, and Small provide a rich resource to bring about radical change. Their proposal is revolutionizing. They introduce six ecumenically diverse mentors of the holy life and build workable bridges to their spiritual legacies. We are led into the adventure of reclaiming these great traditions of spiritual discipline as resources and models for our own spiritual rule. The book is an invitation to pastoral leaders to engage, celebrate, and imitate these and other great exponents of spiritual discipline. The venture could bring about unexpected change, perhaps even the conversion of communities. It's a risk worth taking." (Darrell L. Guder, professor emeritus of missional and ecumenical theology at Princeton Theological Seminary, author of The Continuing Conversion of the Church and Called to Witness)<br><br>"Pastors in North America today face enormous challenges that imperil faithful, joyful ministry. In this engaging and accessible work, John Burgess, Jerry Andrews, and Joseph Small open the wisdom of the Christian past, showing how pastors and the congregations they serve can flourish by disciplined attention to prayer, Scripture, theological reflection, and service with friends in ministry. All those who seek to follow Jesus will find this a rich and rewarding book." (Bradley J. Longfield, professor of church history, University of Dubuque Theological Seminary)<br><br>"If you are a pastor who is feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities, intimidated by social challenges, or simply uncertain about your priorities for how to spend your time and energy, then please read this book. It will relieve you of false burdens, embolden your ministry of the Word, and energize you for your true pastoral vocation. And, for those contemplating a call to become ministers of the gospel, this book provides a rule of 'plumb'&#x2015;namely, a practical plan for stewarding the mysteries of God and for making the potentially crooked pastoral path straight.

However, in March 1945 the Japanese interned all French troops and officials, and turned over all civil government to local authorities. The power vacuum caused by the Japanese surrender allowed the Viet Minh, a strong revolutionary organisation, to be established throughout Vietnam. When the French returned to the north, incidents between French and VM troops were inevitable, negotiations collapsed and the French opted for a military solution. This book examines the history of the conflict and the forces of both sides of the French Indochina War (1946-1954).</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Martin Windrow is series editor at Osprey and an authority on the post-war French army, particularly the Foreign Legion.

In this beautifully illustrated book, Sara Covin Juengst answers this question as she explores the way the metaphor of the garden is used in the Bible.

She also discusses ancient gardening routines, such as plowing, planting, and pruning, to shed light on the significance of the symbolism used in biblical passages that use these images.</p></p><p>In this book, Sara Covin Juengst explores the use of garden as metaphor in the Bible.

Readers will find answers to the following end-of-times questions: <br><br> ?Did the Mayans really say the world will end in December 2012? <br><br> ?How have the signs in the New Testament Book of Revelations been interpreted over the years? <br><br> ?How did ancient Egyptians, Norse, and Chinese think the world would end? <br><br> ?When did Nostradamus predict that the last days would come? <br><br> ?Does the I Ching reference 2012? <br><br> ?Why didn't the world end in Y2K? <br><br> ?Are meteors, global warming, super-volcanoes, and the threat of nuclear war signs that the end is near?</p><p>Sharan Newman is a longtime member of the Medieval Academy, has served on the advisory board for the Medieval Association of the Pacific, and is a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Barbara. Newman&#39;s medieval French mysteries have garnered Macavity, Agatha, and Anthony Award nominations, and she has won the Herodotus Award for Best Historical History.In this cogent history, novelist and medieval historian Newman (The Witch in the Well, The Real History Behind the DaVinci Code) takes a cheerfully skeptical view of end-of-times prophesies beginning with the many flood stories of pre-historical Mesopotamia (including Noah's Ark), and ending with modern apocalyptic visions like the Branch Davidians cult, the contemporary Christian idea of rapture, and the (secular) Y2K scare. In between these bookends, Newman dips into the apocalyptic beliefs of early Christians (such as the vision of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse), Chinese Daoism, the fictional 12th century magician Merlin ( "associated with prophecy" throughout Europe for more than 800 years), and the increasingly infamous Mayan calendar that supposedly "ends" on December 21, 2012, a false prophesy Newman attributes to commentators who don't understand the writing, religion or archaeoastronomy of the ancient civilization: "the Mayans, like the Egyptians, were more concerned with keeping the world going than with when it was going to end." Entertaining and well-footnoted, this guide to the ends of the Earth will inform skeptics but is unlikely to sway believers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hallie had published the first volume of her memoirs, <i>I'll Gather My Geese,</i> in 1991. In that volume she told the story of her life as a pioneer ranch woman and wife in the Big Bend country from the time of her marriage in 1918 to the death of her husband Roy Stillwell in 1948.</p><p>Before HALLIE STILLWELL became too infirm to write, she completed ten chapters of the second volume of her memoirs. She herself titled that work <i>My Goose Is Cooked.</i>BETTY HEATH has assembled stories written by Hallie, collected newspaper articles, and gathered personal remembrances of Hallie to round out the volume."Hallie Stillwell&#x2014;ranch woman, justice of the peace, writer&#x2014;was known and loved far beyond the Big Bend, where she spent most of her near-hundred years. In her second book she tells how she took up the reins after the untimely death of her husband, Roy, and held tenaciously, against all odds, to the ranch where they had shared an eventful though rugged life. Truly a legend in her own time, she had a great story, and she tells it with warmth and good humor."--<i>Elmer </i><i>Kelton</i> -- Elmer Kelton</p><h2>The Macrobiotic Way: The Definitive Guide to Macrobiotic Living</h2><p>The third edition of the "bible" of the macrobiotic movement.<br><br>Originally published in 1985, <b>The Macrobiotic Way</b> is a classic in its field.

Now updated, it covers not only the central dietary principles, nutrition, and foods but also cooking techniques, essentials for a macrobiotic kitchen, menus and recipes, along with exercise, life philosophy, home and lifestyle, and the role of macrobiotics in natural healing.</p><p>Wendy Esko has been teaching macrobiotics since 1976 and works for Eden Foods Inc., the largest distributor of natural and macrobiotic foods in North America.<p>THE<br>MACROBIOTIC<br>WAY</p><p>OTHER AVERY BOOKS<br>ABOUT MACROBIOTICS</p><p><b><i>American Macrobiotic Cuisine</i></b></p><p>MEREDITH MCCARTY</p><p><b><i>Changing Seasons Macrobiotic Cookbook</i></b></p><p>AVELINE KUSHI AND WENDY ESKO</p><p><b><i>The Macrobiotic Approach to Cancer</i></b></p><p>MICHIO KUSHI WITH EDWARD ESKO</p><p><b><i>The Macrobiotic Cancer Prevention Cookbook</i></b></p><p>AVELINE KUSHI WITH WENDY ESKO</p><p><b><i>Macrobiotic Community Cookbook</i></b></p><p>ANDREA BLISS-LERMAN</p><p><b><i>Making the Transition to a Macrobiotic Diet</i></b></p><p>CAROLYN HEIDENRY</p><p>THE<br>MACROBIOTIC<br>WAY</p><p>Preface</p><p>The earliest recorded use of the term <i>macrobiotics</i> is found in the writings of Hippocrates, the father of Western Medicine. In his essay &#x201c;Airs, Waters, and Places,&#x201d; Hippocrates introduced the word to describe people who were healthy and long-lived. Translated from the Greek, <i>macro</i> means &#x201c;large&#x201d; or &#x201c;great,&#x201d; and <i>bios</i> signifies &#x201c;life.&#x201d; Herodotus, Aristotle, Galen, and other classical writers used the term macrobiotics to describe a lifestyle, including a simple balanced diet that promoted health and longevity.</p><p>In the late eighteenth century, the German physician and philosopher Christopher W. Hufeland renewed interest in the term. His influential book on diet and health was entitled <i>Macrobiotics, or The Art of Prolonging Life.</i></p><p>Nearly a century later, the term <i>macrobiotics</i> experienced another revival, this time originating in Japan. Two educators, Sagen Ishizuka, M.D., and Yukikazu Sakurazawa, cured themselves of serious illnesses by adopting a simple diet of brown rice, miso soup, sea vegetables, and other traditional foods. They spent many years studying and integrating traditional Oriental medicine and Eastern philosophy with Judeo-Christian teachings and holistic perspectives in modern science and medicine. Sakurazawa went to Paris in the 1920s. Later, he adopted the name George Ohsawa and applied the term <i>macrobiotics</i> to his teachings.</p><p>From the time of his illness until his death at the age of seventy-four, Ohsawa devoted himself to defining macrobiotics as it applies to modern living. He did much to spread information about the macrobiotic lifestyle, visiting more than thirty countries, giving more than 7,000 lectures, and publishing more than three hundred books.</p><p>Ohsawa had many students, among them Michio Kushi, the author of this book. Kushi was born in 1926 and graduated from Tokyo University with a degree in international law before coming to the United States in 1949. While completing further studies at Columbia University in New York, he also began teaching the macrobiotic approach to diet and health as the areas to achieve world peace. Kushi enjoyed sharing his knowledge of macrobiotics and natural health with others so much that he made it his life&#x2019;s work.</p><p>When Kushi began teaching macrobiotics, he met many people who were eager to learn, but were unaccustomed to eating simple whole foods. He saw that there was a need to adapt the macrobiotic diet to modern tastes while retaining its integrity. Over the years, Kushi has traveled extensively, lecturing and teaching the macrobiotic way to groups around the world.</p><p>Macrobiotics advocates the use of traditional foods such as whole grains, beans, and locally grown vegetables as the primary sources of food energy and nutrition. In addition, the diet includes nutritious soyfoods, which have been used in Asia for hundreds of years, and mineral-rich foods from the ocean&#x2014;sea vegetables and certain types of fish. In the macrobiotic diet, moderate amounts of white-meat fish and shellfish are often substituted for the red meat and poultry that are common elements of the typical Western diet. Sea salt and natural grain sweeteners such as rice syrup and barley malt replace the refined salt and sugar that currently play a major role in modern fare.</p><p>When Michio Kushi first accepted the challenge of helping people shift to a more healthful way of eating and living, he had trouble finding many of the wholesome foods that he recommended. So, with his late wife, Aveline, he started a natural foods business to fill the need. Later to be called Erewhon Foods, this small enterprise developed into a $17 million business specializing in macrobiotic and natural foods. After acquiring the nearly 100-year-old U.S. Mills, the company adopted U.S. Mills as its name, and Erewhon remains as a brand name.</p><p>To research and popularize the macrobiotic approach, Michio and Aveline Kushi founded the East-West Foundation and the Kushi Institute (of which their son Phiya is now executive director), both nonprofit educational organizations; the <i>East West Journal</i>, a monthly magazine that reached a worldwide circulation of more than 75,000 copies; and several macrobiotic restaurants. The Kushis had five children and five grandchildren.</p><p>Michio and Aveline Kushi wrote many books on macrobiotics, including <i>The Book of Macrobiotics; The Book of Do-In: Exercise for Physical and Spiritual Development; The Cancer Prevention Diet; Your Face Never Lies: An Introduction to Oriental Diagnosis; The Macrobiotic Approach to Cancer; Natural Healing Through Macrobiotics; How to Cook with Miso; The Changing Seasons Macrobiotic Cookbook;</i> and <i>Macrobiotic Pregnancy and Care of the Newborn.</i> Michio Kushi is also the author of a series of books, Teachings of Michio Kushi.</p><p>I came to know Michio and Aveline Kushi well&#x2014;both extraordinary people with endless reserves of energy, patience, and compassion for others. As a scholar, philosopher, writer, and teacher, Michio Kushi is often busy from early in the morning until after midnight. Whether he is greeting individuals for counseling sessions, discussing plans for the further development and growth of the macrobiotic way, attending a session of the macrobiotic scientific committee, giving a seminar for medical and health-care professionals, or just talking about life with a friend, Kushi is always actively sharing his boundless enthusiasm for living and his ability to view life&#x2019;s problems with gentle good humor.</p><p>This book is the result of my desire to understand Michio Kushi&#x2019;s macrobiotic approach to diet and health and to explain it in simple terms to a general audience. Michio Kushi is the author of this book inasmuch as its contents are derived from discussions with him. In addition, material from his lectures, published books, and articles has been drawn upon.</p><p>Both Michio and I are indebted to our families and friends for their valuable assistance in preparing this book. We would especially like to thank Aveline Kushi and Wendy Esko for helping to develop the recipes and cooking sections, with the assistance of Karen Williamson, Caroline Heindenry, and Colleen Blauer. Special thanks also go to Lawrence Haruo Kushi of the Harvard School of Public Health, to Phillip Kushi and Ed Esko of the East West Foundation, to Bill Tara of the Kushi Institute, and to Lenny Jacobs, Linda Roszak, and Mark Mayell of the <i>East West Journal</i>, for reviewing the style, tone, accuracy, and clarity of the other sections of the book.</p><p>My greatest hope is that the spirit of sharing and cooperation, through which this book became a reality, will somehow touch the lives of its readers. For in giving is to be found abundance, peace, and happiness.</p><p><i>Stephen Blauer<br>Boston</i></p><p>Introduction</p><p>Macrobiotics is a way of eating and living that has been practiced for thousands of years by many people around the world. It stems from an intuitive understanding of the orderliness of nature. Modern macrobiotic philosophy focuses on offering a way of living that closes the widening gap between humans and the natural world. Macrobiotic theory suggests that sickness and unhappiness are nature&#x2019;s way of urging us to adopt a proper diet and way of life, and that these troubles are unnecessary when we live in harmony with our environment. The macrobiotic diet is based on whole grains and traditional foods in harmony with the seasons.</p><p>As we have become somewhat removed from the natural elements, we have lost much that is valuable. We can learn a great deal from cultures such as those of the Hunzakut people, of a region now in northeast Pakistan; the Vilcabambans, who live high in the South American Andes; and the Abkhasians, who reside in an area of the former Soviet republic of Georgia located between southern Russia and the Black Sea. One characteristic shared by these cultures is that the people often live in continuous close contact with nature. They are also vitally healthy and very active physically, many beyond their hundredth birthday. Most of the foods they eat are locally and organically grown, vegetarian, and unprocessed. Their diet is essentially macrobiotic, as it is based primarily on whole cereal grains such as wheat, barley, buckwheat, corn, and brown rice, with fresh vegetables and greens, peas, nuts, beans, and fruits. Though they do eat some meat, dairy products, and poultry, these foods account for less than 1 percent of the diet.</p><p>We may not be able to adopt these peoples&#x2019; level of activity (although many people feel we should), or their more rustic lifestyle, but we can adopt a more wholesome diet. In fact, nutritional research performed for the United States government has long recommended a more simple approach to diet. Two publications, <i>Dietary Goals for the United States</i> and <i>Diet, Nutrition and Cancer</i> came out in favor&#x2014;in 1977 and 1982, respectively&#x2014;of sweeping dietary changes, including more whole grains, whole-grain products, beans, fresh vegetables, and fruits, and less red meat, cheese, eggs, poultry, and highly refined foods that are lacking in fiber. The studies also recommend reducing salt, sugar, and fat consumption.</p><p>Medical and nutritional scientists believe such dietary changes can reduce the incidence of heart disease, hypertension, obesity, gallbladder and liver disorders, and cancer. The first report, issued by the McGovern Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, concluded that our present eating habits &#x201c;may be as profoundly damaging to the nation&#x2019;s health as the widespread contagious diseases of the early part of the century.&#x201d;</p><p>Although these monumental studies received little, if any, attention from the news media at the time, thousands of people began turning to alternatives such as the macrobiotic diet to prevent illness and improve their health. Several well-known physicians, including Dr. Keith Block, a medical and nutritional consultant for CBS radio in Chicago, and Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, former medical director of the American International Hospital in Zion, Illinois, praised the macrobiotic diet as a ray of hope in the prevention of illness.</p><p>Drs. Edward Kass and Frank Sacks of Harvard University reported in the <i>American Journal of Epidemology,</i> May 1974, that the macrobiotic diet normalized blood pressure. Their study of 210 individuals who switched to macrobiotics showed that the largely vegetarian diet was effective in bringing high blood pressure down to normal levels and that it maintained these levels far more effectively than the diet eaten by the average American.</p><p>A year later, <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> published another study by Drs. Kass and Sacks, this time stating that people who switched to the macrobiotic diet had healthier-than-average blood fat and cholesterol levels, despite having eaten the typical modern diet (which tends to elevate blood fat and cholesterol levels) most of their lives. In 1982, J. T. Knuiman and C. E. West confirmed Drs. Kass and Sacks&#x2019;s findings in their own research, which compared the total blood fat and cholesterol levels of macrobiotic, vegetarian, and nonvegetarian males. Their report was published in the journal <i>Atherosclerosis.</i></p><p>The success of the macrobiotic diet in controlling blood pressure, fat, and cholesterol levels has made it medically credible. Some physicians are now recommending it to their patients along with standard medical treatments. In fact, at Boston&#x2019;s Lemuel Shattuck Hospital, wholesome macrobiotic meals are available to the staff and some patients. In Linho, Portugal, a group of prisoners have been given the opportunity to eat macrobiotically. Chico Varatojo, director of a macrobiotic center for the prison, feels that the poorly balanced nutrition of the conventional diet is largely responsible for crime and delinquency in modern society.</p><p>Unlike most other diets, macrobiotics has continued to grow and expand its sphere of influence for well over fifty years. Macrobiotic educators have been pioneers of the natural and organic foods revolution. Today, there are more than 500 learning centers teaching macrobiotics worldwide. In just about any large city, from Dublin to Dallas and from Athens to Atlanta, you will find people following the macrobiotic way. In many cities you will find one or more macrobiotic restaurants or restaurants that serve macrobiotic meals. Many individuals throughout the world have tried macrobiotics and discovered that it truly helped them to overcome poor health, even if they had been suffering for some time. They credit three factors as contributing to successful recovery:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;The proper quality, quantity, and combination of well-prepared food;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Regular exercise; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;A positive mental outlook.<p>These aspects of the macrobiotic way are the focal points of this book. In the chapters that follow, you will learn what the macrobiotic diet consists of, how it compares to the diet currently eaten in many parts of the world, and exactly how you can use the macrobiotic diet and lifestyle to improve your health and that of your family.</p><p>ONE</p><p>The Way to Better Health</p><p><b>T</b>he macrobiotic approach to diet, exercise, and living can lead to better health for you and your family. If you choose to eat macrobiotically and follow the other suggestions in this book, you will reap the rewards of an active, intelligent, energizing approach to life. You will discover richness and harmony in nature, even amidst the pressures and hazards of our complicated world.</p><p>Macrobiotic philosophy teaches that a wholesome diet is the most direct path to good health, so the first part of this book is directed to examining the role of nutrition in the macrobiotic way. More so than any other approach to diet, macrobiotics appreciates and emphasizes individual differences such as where you live, what you do, and your present state of health.</p><p>Based on the philosophic principles of balance and harmony, the idea behind the diet is simple: your climate or geographical location, activity level, and physiology determine your nutritional needs. In making dietary choices, these factors are far better guides to follow than general nutritional and caloric tables.</p><p>In addition, macrobiotics points out the harmful effect modern methods of food processing and refining have upon our physical and mental health. The macrobiotic diet uses only whole foods and foods that are processed by traditional methods.</p><p>WHOLE, UNPROCESSED FOODS</p><p>Unlike the people of Hunza, Vilcabamba, and other traditional cultures, who eat locally gr...</p></p><h2>The Lady's Stratagem: A Repository of 1820s Directions for the Toilet, Mantua-Making, Stay-Making, Millinery &amp; Etiquette</h2><p>The Lady&#39;s Stratagem is a comprehensive, step-by-step, illustrated guide to early 19th-century dressmaking, corset making, millinery, knitting, embroidery, clothing care, beauty treatments, and manners.

People scream and run for their lives. Larry, meanwhile, has a quizzical look on his face and asks, What, are you people nuts?&#x201d;<br>What makes Larry a monster, and why doesn&#x2019;t he know that he&#x2019;s a monster? <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm and Philosophy</i> discusses several answers to these questions.<br>This book revolves around <i>Curb</i>-Larry, the character that the real Larry David plays on HBO&#x2019;s popular television series: his outlook on life, his unusual ways of interacting with people, his inability or unwillingness to conform to the world. Many of the chapters discuss ethical and existential issues, such as whether Larry is a bad apple.&#x201d;<br>Larry doesn&#x2019;t ask questions about free will, or wonder whether the world outside our minds really exists because he&#x2019;s more like Socrates than Descartes. He tells bitter truths about how we live our lives. There's something heroic about Larry's independence from social conventions, and something tragic about his tendency to hurt people with his frankness. It's hard not to ask, <i>should</i> we curb our enthusiasm?</p><p><b>Mark Ralkowski</b> is Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Honors at The George Washington University.

However from the Biblical witness it is clear that it is an essential component of a healthy, God-honoring church - a church where Christians grow and mature in grace and develop solid foundations with which they can, with the help of the Spirit, withstand the storms of life. <br>With many years of pastoral experience, Robert K. Cheong has faced this issue many times. Additionally he interviewed over 30 pastors from different countries and a wide variety of church settings. </p></p><p>Robert K. Cheong is the pastor responsible for Care and Counselling at Sojourn Community Church, Louisville, Kentucky. He is married to Karen and they have three grown children. <br><br>May the Lord use it to help us, as his church, become the beautiful bride she was purchased to be. (Steve Timmis ~ Executive Director of the Acts 29 Network)<br><br>...a wonderfully practical and refreshingly gracious treatment of the topic. Even those who don't subscribe to everything Cheong says will find this book to be a significant help. (Thomas R. Schreiner ~ James Buchanan Harrison Professor of New Testament Interpretation and Associate Dean, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky)<br><br>The subject of church discipline is no walk in the park. People's lives hang in the balance. My friend Robert clearly shows that church discipline is an integral part of gospel centered ministry both theologically and practically. He provides a step by step guide so that the reader understands not only what discipline is but how to go about it. In the process, he gives us a model for the body of Christ ministering to one another in the grace, compassion, and humility characteristic of the gospel. This is a must read for every pastor. (Rob Green ~ Pastor of Counseling and Seminary Ministries, Faith Church, Lafayette, Indiana)<br><br>It has taken courage for Robert Cheong to write this book. He is knowingly wading into an area of much confusion and regret in churches. Church discipline is a ministry which, even if it is done well, it can be a painful experience for all involved. So it also takes the heart of a shepherd to speak to those leading through church discipline or living somewhere in it. Robert has the courage and shepherd's heart - and the Gospel clarity - to help us all in difficult times where church discipline is the redemptive way ahead. (Andy Farmer ~ Pastor of Community and Care, Covenant Fellowship Church, Glen Mills, PA)<br><br>I appreciate this book for three reasons. First, it's theologically rich, anchoring church discipline in the glorious drama of God's redeeming work. Second, it's pastorally wise, written by a seasoned shepherd who knows the joy and pain of leading and protecting the flock. And third, it's practically helpful - the appendices alone are worth the price of the book. Robert's work on this important subject is a gift to every gospel-loving church leader and church member. (Bob Thune ~ Co-author of The Gospel-Centered Life, Lead Pastor, Coram Deo Church Community, Omaha, Nebraska)<br><br>It was impossible for me to read this book without being personally convicted by my lack of faithfulness to live out the radical love of Jesus in the context of a community on mission. My failure to pursue people who have sinned and hurt the church was shown to be significant. Additionally, the book is full of sage advice on exactly HOW to walk through the rigors of church discipline. The day after I read it, I found myself quoting it several times. It's hard for me to imagine someone writing a more helpful, practical, gospel-centered book on church discipline. (Abe Meysenburg ~ Pastor and Elder, Soma Communities, Tacoma, Washington)<br><br>Robert Cheong is committed to fostering gospel-centered communities that express the full range of God's love toward one another, even when it comes to correction and discipline. He expands our view of church discipline considerably by mining the riches of God's Word and grand redemptive story-beyond the handful of classic "church discipline" passages-and casting a vision for the whole church living as a patient, loving, wise, intentional, and personally engaged community. He's packed the appendices with invaluable practical guidelines to help us diligently work out the details.

Images of becoming, of existential pain, search and confusion, love, death, and transcendence are icons in the long corridors of Grey&#x2019;s creative odyssey. From his earliest self-portraits and paintings of skeletons, to his most recent universal beings gridded with fire and eyes, Grey brings us an ever-deepening visual contemplation on the nature of personal and transpersonal identity.<br><br><em>Transfigurations</em> is a continuation of the dialogue between body and soul begun in Grey&#x2019;s first book <em>Sacred Mirrors</em>--one of the most successful art books of the 1990s. <em>Transfigurations</em> includes all of Grey&#x2019;s major works completed in the following decade, presented here in 202 color reproductions and 93 black-and-white images. These works include the masterful seven-paneled Buddhist altarpiece <em>Nature of Mind; World Soul</em>, a bronze sculpture of a divine being that symbolically encompasses all realms of consciousness; and Cosmic Christ, a vision of Christ that embraces all religions and the countless dimensions of the universe. <br><br>An essay by renowned author and transpersonal psychologist Stephen Larsen provides a biographical sketch of the artist&#x2019;s creative process, struggling with his demons and glimpsing the light of the beyond within. Grey&#x2019;s early forays into dark, transgressive performance art and his later theophanic installations are all documented in a special twenty-page performance section. Art critic Donald Kuspit elucidates Grey&#x2019;s primary subject, mystical light, as it manifests through his unique approach to the human figure. A conversation between noted philosopher Ken Wilber and the artist explores the exciting possibilities of art serving as a vehicle for transformation. Albert Hofmann, the chemist who discovered LSD, writes the foreword that places Grey&#x2019;s work at the conjunction of science and mysticism. <br><br>Grey&#x2019;s paintings offer the viewer unforgettable glimpses of transfiguration, as bodies become translucent to the light of Spirit, transparent to the ground of being. The occurrence of beholding and becoming &#x201c;the light&#x201d; is a phenomenon that is described in all religions and wisdom paths. Grey&#x2019;s &#x201c;X-ray&#x201d; visions show the complex interplay of the anatomical body and the glowing subtle energies of the soul, unveiling the relationship between our finite self and infinite spirit. Grey&#x2019;s quest is toward an integrative art that visually unites body, mind, soul, and spirit and helps heal the alienation and fragmentation felt between the individual and the world. <br><br>ALEX GREY is the author of <em>Sacred Mirrors: The Visionary Art of Alex Grey</em> and <em>The Mission of Art</em>.

Also included in this collection are reflections on the special qualities of art museums, an investigation into the relationship of current copyright law to the visual arts, a detailed consideration of how the museums and legal system of the United States have coped with the problem of Nazi-era art, and a series of delightfully provocative training exercises for those anticipating entry into the museum field.</p><p><b>Stephen E.

Already a sensational world star, Chang produces a buzzing fusion of Korean/Asian and Western cuisine, creating a style of food which defies easy categorisation. That it is fantastic, there is no doubt, and that it is eminently cookable, there is also no doubt! In the words of Chang himself, it is &#39;Bad pseudo-fusion cuisine&#39;.

Backed by undeniably informed technique and a clearly passionate advocation of cutting-edge fusion cooking, Chang&#39;s &#34;Momofuku&#34; is a stunning, no-holds barred, debut.

Ever. It&#x2019;s definitely a mother sauce at Momofuku, something that we use over and over and over again. If you have ginger scallion sauce in the fridge, you will never go hungry: stir 6 tablespoons into a bowl of hot noodles--lo mein, rice noodles, Shanghai thick noodles--and you&#x2019;re in business. Or serve over a bowl of rice topped with a fried egg. Or with grilled meat or any kind of seafood. Or almost anything. </p> <p>At Noodle Bar, we add a few vegetables to the Noodletown dish to appease the vegetarians, add a little sherry vinegar to the sauce to cut the fat, and leave off the squirt of hoisin sauce that Noodletown finishes the noodles with. (Not because it&#x2019;s a bad idea or anything, just that we&#x2019;ve got hoisin in our pork buns, and too much hoisin in a meal can be too much of a good thing. Feel free to add it back.) </p> <p>The dish goes something like this: boil 6 ounces of ramen noodles, drain, toss with 6 tablespoons Ginger Scallion Sauce (below); top the bowl with 1/4 cup each of Bamboo Shoots (page 54 of <i>Momofuku</i>); Quick-Pickled Cucumbers (page 65 of <i>Momofuku</i>); pan-roasted cauliflower (a little oil in a hot wide pan, 8 or so minutes over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the florets are dotted with brown and tender all the way through; season with salt); a pile of sliced scallions; and a sheet of toasted nori. But that&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;ve always got all that stuff on hand. Improvise to your needs, but know that you need ginger scallion sauce on your noodles, in your fridge, and in your life.

It's almost the end of the war and Paul Peachy, a young railway employee and amateur actor in Milwaukee, realizes his marriage is one-sided. He enlists, and ships off to France. Peachy instantly realizes how out of his depth he is&#x2015;and never more so than when he is captured. Risking everything, Peachy&#x2015;who as a child of immigrants speaks German&#x2015;makes the reckless decision to impersonate one of the enemy's most famous spies.</p><p>As the urbane and accomplished spy Harry Stroller, Peachy has access to a world he could never have known existed&#x2015;a world of sumptuous living, world-weary men, and available women. But when one of those women&#x2015;Annie, a young, beautiful and wary courtesan&#x2015;turns out to be more than she seems, Peachy's life is transformed forever.</p></p><p><b>Gene Wilder (1933-2016) </b>began acting when he was thirteen and writing for the screen since the early 1970s. After a small role in Bonnie and Clyde pulled him away from a career onstage, he was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his role as Leo Bloom in The Producers, which led to Blazing Saddles and then to another Academy nomination, this time for writing Young Frankenstein. Wilder has appeared in twenty-five feature films and a number of stage productions. His first book, about his own life, was <i>Kiss Me Like A Stranger,</i> and was followed by the novels <i>My French Whore, The Woman Who Wouldn&#x2019;t , What Is This Thing Called Love?</i> and S<i>omething to Remember You By.</i><p><strong>Chapter One</strong>March, 1918I used to be a conductor on the train that ran back and forth from Milwaukee to Chicago. Two or three times a year I acted in our local community theater, playing small roles mostly, but occasionally I was given a featured role. When the Milwaukee Players were putting on a play called A Brave Coward, by Winslow Clarke, I was given the part of a cowardly soldier during the Civil War who chooses, for the first time, to do something heroic. This was the biggest role our director had ever given me.Our community theater gave only three performances for each of our plays, and on the last night of A Brave Coward I was in the men&#x2019;s dressing room applying some Skolgie&#x2019;s theatrical glue onto a mustache I&#x2019;d made out of crepe hair, pressing it hard above my upper lip, when our director walked in. His name was John Freidel, but all the actors called him &#x201c;sir&#x201d; because we were a little afraid of him.He walked past the other men, who were getting into costumes and going over their lines, and came up to my chair. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re late, Peachy,&#x201c; he said.&#x201d;Sorry, sir, I came right from work. The train was late.&#x201d;&#x201d;Sir&#x201d; could be very sarcastic when he was giving notes, but I hadn&#x2019;t heard him yell at anyone yet. He was a tall man and I thought his knee would hurt when he kneeled down next to me on the hard wooden floor, but I certainly wasn&#x2019;t going to interrupt him. He spoke confidentially, but he was very intense.&#x201d;You&#x2019;ve been way too soft these last few nights, Paul. Terribly gentle and polite. A coward isn&#x2019;t a coward all the goddamn time, you know? You&#x2019;re starting to act like you&#x2019;re scared to death. Will you loosen up for me tonight?&#x201d;&#x201d;I&#x2019;ll try, sir,&#x201c; I said.&#x201d;When the curtain goes up, forget the goddamn audience! Pretend it&#x2019;s just a rehearsal. Will you do that for me, Paul?&#x201d;&#x201d;I&#x2019;ll try.&#x201d;Twenty minutes later my heart was in my throat. I heard the stage manager whisper &#x201c;Go!&#x201d; and the curtain went up. There was silence for a moment as the audience waited, and then the first line was spoken.Thank goodness the play went well, and I know the audience liked me because they clapped especially loud when I took my bow during the curtain calls. I looked out into the audience while I was bowing and saw our director sitting in the front row. He gave me a smile and a little nod of approval.When the play was over I kept my mustache on, which I had purposely made the color of my wife&#x2019;s auburn hair. I kept trying to picture Elsie when she saw it. Elsie and I had only been married for four and a half years, but the romantic part of our relationship seemed to have faded away, like the yellow roses in our backyard at the end of summer. I lived with Elsie and her mother in three rooms on the second floor of a small but clean house in the German-Polish section of Milwaukee.On the bus ride home a pretty girl and a soldier were sitting across the aisle from me, holding hands. The girl smiled at me. Without thinking, I touched my mustache and smiled back at her. Her boyfriend turned and gave me a hard stare. I dropped my head, pretending to be reading my theater program.When I got home I raced up the stairs and unlocked the kitchen door. There was a soft light coming from the half-open door of our bedroom. I stuck my head into the doorway.&#x201d;Look who&#x2019;s here!&#x201d; I said, as rakishly as I could. Elsie was asleep, propped up against two big pillows, her long auburn hair spread out around her. A gas lamp was burning on the nightstand. The sound of my voice woke her.&#x201d;Oh, Paul,&#x201c; she said, still half asleep.&#x201d;I&#x2019;m sorry, honey--I didn&#x2019;t know you were sleeping. How do you feel?&#x201d;&#x201d;I was waiting up, and then I just dozed off,&#x201c; she said.I made a tiny leap, trying to feature my mustache. &#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s here!&#x201d; I said.&#x201d;What time is it?&#x201d; Elsie asked, trying to see the little table clock on my side of the bed.&#x201d;It must be a little past ten,&#x201c; I said. &#x201c;How do you feel, Elsie?&#x201d;&#x201d;Is my mother&#x2019;s light out?&#x201d; she asked.There wasn&#x2019;t any light coming from the adjoining bedroom.&#x201d;Yes, it&#x2019;s out,&#x201c; I said.Still trying to get Elsie to notice my mustache, I made another little John Barrymore leap in the air and said,&#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s here, Elsie.&#x201d;&#x201d;Paul, if you&#x2019;re going to eat something, please hurry.&#x201d;&#x201d;I&#x2019;m not hungry, Elsie.&#x201d;&#x201d;You must be starving,&#x201c; she said.&#x201d;No, I had something on the train. Honestly, I&#x2019;m not hungry. How do you feel?&#x201d;&#x201d;If you cared how I felt, would you have left me tonight?&#x201d;&#x201d;Well... I did care, even though I left, so the answer must be &#x2018;Yes.&#x2019; You look so pretty with your hair that way.&#x201d;&#x201d;I don&#x2019;t feel pretty.&#x201d;&#x201d;Isn&#x2019;t life funny, because you do look so pretty?&#x201d;&#x201d;Thank you.&#x201d;I walked up and sat beside her on the bed. &#x201c;I brought you something, sweetheart.&#x201d;&#x201d;You didn&#x2019;t bring me another pastry?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Oh, Paul, why do you do that?&#x201d;&#x201d;It must be love,&#x201c; I said, taking her hand.&#x201d;You&#x2019;ve still got makeup all over your face. Did you know that?&#x201d;&#x201d;I must have forgotten--I was so excited after the play, and I wanted to get home before you went to sleep.&#x201d;I leaned down and kissed her, then took off my trousers and underwear and socks, leaving on my shirt. I turned down the lamp and got into bed.&#x201d;Don&#x2019;t touch me like that, Paul.&#x201d;&#x201d;Why?&#x201d;&#x201d;I don&#x2019;t feel like it,&#x201c; she said.&#x201d;Why?&#x201d;Elsie turned away. I lay next to her for a while, until I finally fell asleep.The next morning I was punching tickets on the ride back to Milwaukee. The car was stuffed with soldiers and their girlfriends or wives.

On May 27, 1943, his B&#x2013;24 crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Louis and two other survivors found a raft amid the flaming wreckage and waited for rescue. Instead, they drifted two thousand miles for forty&#x2013;seven days. Their only food: two shark livers and three raw albatross. Their only water: sporadic rainfall. Their only companions: hope and faith&#x2013;and the ever&#x2013;present sharks. On the forty&#x2013;seventh day, mere skeletons close to death, Zamperini and pilot Russell Phillips spotted land&#x2013;and were captured by the Japanese. Thus began more than two years of torture and humiliation as a prisoner of war.</p><p> Zamperini was threatened with beheading, subject to medical experiments, routinely beaten, hidden in a secret interrogation facility, starved and forced into slave labour, and was the constant victim of a brutal prison guard nicknamed the Bird&#x2013;a man so vicious that the other guards feared him and called him a psychopath. Meanwhile, the Army Air Corps declared Zamperini dead and President Roosevelt sends official condolences to his family, who never gave up hope that he was alive.</p></p><p><p> Louis Zamperini is the subject of Lauren Hillenbrand's critically acclaimed biography <i>Unbroken</i>, the research for which was conducted over the course of more than 75 phone calls between Zamperini and the author, resulting in hundreds of hours of interviews. Zamperini is a regular lecturer, appearing before student groups, veterans, troubled youth, sports clubs, senior citizens, and religious organizations. Zamperini, now 93, lives in Hollywood, and only recently gave up skateboarding. </p>Zamperini was an intractable troublemaker of a youth who became a champion runner, competing in the 1936 Olympics and shaking hands with Hitler and Goebbels. When war seemed inevitable, he joined the Army Air Corps and flew a number of combat missions in the Pacific as a B-24 bombardier. In May 1943, his plane crashed on a routine search mission, and Zamperini and two survivors floated on a raft for 47 days before being taken prisoner by the Japanese. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps undergoing terrible abuse, as did many prisoners in Japan. After the war, disaffected and rootless, he attended an early Billy Graham revival and found religion. He became an inspirational speaker, eventually returned to Japan to confront and forgive his captors, and spent the rest of his life spreading Christianity and supporting various Christian endeavors. His memoir will fit well in inspirational collections, but it is also a well-written addition to the growing body of World War II personal narratives. Zamperini's positive attitude, resilience, and narrative strength make this a reasonable purchase for many public libraries and military collections. [During the 1998 Winter Olympics in Japan, Zamperini's story and dramatic return to face his torturer was chronicled on CBS's 48 Hours.-Ed.]-Edwin B.

He shows us the history of the cathedral and teaches us how to "read" the world-famous stained glass and sculpture, explaining the references to Scripture and the teachings of the Church. <p> Chartres alone, of all the great medieval churches, has survived into the 20th century almost intact, not only architecturally but with its vast inconographic program in 12th-and 13th-century stained glass and sculpture. </p><p> Medieval art was intended not just to embellish the church but to instruct the people, for there was no printing. Scholars could therefore teach their students, the clergy preach sermons and parents read the lives of the saints to their children using the 'texts' in stained glass and sculpture. The sister churches of Chartres have been sadly vandalized to varying degrees by Reform, revolution, war or natural disaster. Here in Chartres the 'text' is virtually complete.</p><p> A concise glossary of symbolic images has been included as well as a complete plan of all the windows in the cathedral, and an index.</p></p><p></p><h2>Sex Scandal: The Drive to Abolish Male and Female</h2><p>Men and women used to cheer: <i>vive la diff�rence</i>!<br><br>But now, contrary to all science and common sense, we&#x2019;re supposed to believe that there is no difference.

Although many of us hear anecdotal stories here and there that demonstrate how the gender issue is gaining steam, I had no idea this ideology has penetrated our culture so deeply. Despite the medical community's evidence that sex is a more significant index than previously thought, gender radicals are relentlessly strong-arming their agenda of gender neutrality and gaining momentum across America like a rapidly spreading virus. Written in a smart, modern tone, thoroughly researched (61 pages of footnotes), and covering many segments of society (schools, universities, the military, sports, hollywood, etc.), this book demonstrates the bizarre schizophrenia that characterizes the elite 'thought police' of the extreme Left. Where the Left used to claim the moral high ground in supporting women and their rights across the board, Mcguire reveals how their current agenda of denying the differences between male and female is actually leaving women more vulnerable than ever as this gender theory delegitimizes claims of abuse or discrimination that originate from our sex. This book is not shrill or whining - McGuire encourages empathy for those who genuinely do experience confusion about their sex, but she does meticulously and logically argue the benefits to all of recognizing our unique differences. The author frequently uses her own personal stories to illustrate her platform. Sex Scandal is an important book for just about ANY reader, from an academic in the throes of the issue to a new parent contemplating the challenges and choices ahead for their child. How society narrates what IDENTITY is impacts ALL of us directly and deeply. It's time to wake up and use our voice. Thank you for this tool Ashley McGuire." "Human biology is under siege--at the workplace, on the playing field, in classrooms and bathrooms, and even in our dictionaries! In this ground-breaking and meticulously researched book, Ashley McGuire plunges into every front of the progressives' war on the sexes. She rips the lid off the Left's obliteration of the fundamental differences between men and women. She exposes the profound havoc militant feminists and gender-bending crusaders are causing in our schools and culture. <i>Sex Scandal</i> searingly documents how the radical pursuit of 'gender neutrality' threatens true equality for all. McGuire's work is both an invaluable resource and a brave public service."<br>--Michelle Malkin, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Culture of Corruption and Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild</i> <p></p>"The 'war on boys' turned into a rout and we now live in an Orwellian society where everything about 'sex' and 'gender' is dictated to us by a group of powerful, ideological bullies.

The Enfield rifle was noted for several design features. It was designed with a rear receiver aperture sight, protected by sturdy "ears," a design that proved to be faster and more accurate than the typical mid-barrel sight. Future American rifles, such as the 1903-A3 Springfield, M1 and M1 Carbine would all use such receiver sights. The M1917 sight was situated on an elongated receiver bridge, which added weight to the action, as well as lengthening the bolt. The M1917 action proved very strong, and was used as the basis for a variety of commercial and gunsmith-made sporting rifles in standard and magnum calibers between the world wars and after.Today, the Enfield is used as a ceremonial and drilling rifle. For battle purposes, the Danish still use the M1917 as a service weapon due to the high reliability of the bolt-action rifle in harsh conditions.Created in 1942, this field manual reveals a great deal about the M1917&#x2019;sdesign and capabilities. Intended as a field manual for operation and maintenance, it details gun assembly, marksmanship techniques, accessories, and much more.

Here schools and churches were completely integrated, blacks and whites intermarried, and power and wealth were shared by both races. But for this to happen, the town&#x2019;s citizens had to keep secrets, break the laws of the world outside, and sweep aside fear and embrace hope.&nbsp;In a historical-detective feat, Anna-Lisa Cox uncovers the heartening story of this community that took the road untaken. Beginning in the 1860s, the people of Covert, Michigan, attempted to do what then seemed impossible: love one&#x2019;s neighbor&#x2014;regardless of skin color&#x2014;as oneself. Drawing on diaries, oral histories, and contemporary records, Cox gives us intimate glimpses of Covert&#x2019;s people, from William Conner, the Civil War veteran who went on to become Michigan's first black justice of the peace, to Elizabeth Gillard, who, shipwrecked and washed onto Covert's shores, ultimately came to love the unusual community she would call home. In bringing these and other stories of this small town to light, Cox presents a vision of what our nation might have been, and could be.</p><p>Anna-Lisa Cox is the recipient of numerous awards for her research, including a National Endowment for the Humanities Younger Scholars Award, a Gilder Lehrman Fellowship, and a Pew Younger Scholars Fellowship.&#x201c;Readers of <i>A Stronger Kinship</i> will enjoy its prose, admire its characters, and very likely agree with Cox that the history of this small Michigan town teaches us about hope and the possibility for racial reconciliation in our own time.&#x201d;&#x2014;Frank Towers, <i>Chicago Tribune</i> (Frank Towers <i>Chicago Tribune</i> 2006-03-25)<br><br>&#x201c;An inspirational story of tolerance and decency.&#x201d;&#x2014;Diane Robert, <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> (Diane Roberts <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> 2006-03-12)<br><br>&#x201c;A gladdening, unsentimental chronicle of a Midwestern town that practiced racial equality against all late 19th-century odds.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (<i>Kirkus</i> 2005-12-15)<br><br>&#x201c;Anna-Lisa Cox brings us the remarkable story of this extraordinary place, Covert, Michigan.

Someone whom I can only imagine, but never truly visualize or come to understand? Why put any effort at all into contacting someone who came ever so close to ending my life with just the twitch of a finger? It's a valid question whose response is not very easy to articulate. But I suppose I have to try.<br><br>The scar from where the bullet entered my back is still there. It always will be, like a tattoo or stretch marks. I honestly never think about it now, as it is out of my sight line, but every so often it rises from the obscurity of my skin. At times a lover will be running her fingers down my neck in a caring, intimate manner and her finger will catch on that point. It feels like a zit now, no larger than a bee sting really. Still, the question always comes: "What's this from?"<br><br>The veracity of my answer will always depend on my feelings for the questioner. If I believe she will be around for a while, if she is someone whom I care enough about to share this darkness with, I will give just a little, but only so much.<br><br>"Oh, I was involved in an incident a while back," I'll say. You can't reveal too much too soon, you know. There's gotta be some mystery.<br><br>If it is someone I just leaned on for comfort at a particular moment, or someone I can tell is not truly "share-worthy," well, then she will receive the casual, harmless white lie. There will be no follow?up response. Not even eye contact. "Oh, that's nothing. Childish roughhousing," I will ramble off as if swatting away a fly. The majority have received the latter. I don't really like to share. It's not in my nature anymore. The events that occurred to produce that scar are not really a place I care to visit. As the saying goes, I have moved on. And I'm proud to make that statement. But now-in this moment in time-addressing It, addressing You, just feels appropriate. Until I speak to you, I can never fully close this door. And I need that resolution. I think I've earned it.<br><br>You-my nameless, faceless friend with whom I share such a close, personal relationship-do you ever think about me? Do you ever wonder what became of me-that kid whom you saw walking down the street that one brisk night in January? Was it your intention to link us indelibly with your simple, somewhat effortless act of violence? Were you even remotely aware of the potency of such an act? Did you blink? Give it a second thought? Did you say to yourself, Maybe I shouldn't do this?<br><br>I have created over a hundred scenarios for how we "met." With all my time in the hospital there was nothing to do but obsess. It was fascinating at first, putting together those shards of a jigsaw that would forever lack pieces. In my mind you are either black or Latino. Why? Simple deduction, since those are the only types of people who lived in that area where we grew up. I'm going to go ahead and make you black. I have the power now. You are positively a male since women don't typically go about ghettos shooting guns to prove their worthiness. Women don't really grow up with thuggish gun fantasies, do they? They sure as hell didn't back in 1982.<br><br>Maybe your name is Leroy. Or Tito. Or Dante. Or Hector. Or Tyrone. Or Javier. Or Jamal. Or Luis. For my own purposes, I have decided to give you a name. It helps me, you see, to give you a human character. You and I, we have such a poignant story and without a name for you the story is too difficult to convey. I am going to call you Marcus. Why Marcus? I don't know. That name speaks to me for reasons not fully apparent, and I believe in going with my first instinct. It fits. It just feels right. And so Marcus it is. Now tell me, Marcus, do you ever ask yourself, What the fuck ever happened to that little dude that I shot in the back that one New Year's night? Did he die or what? Or maybe I just grazed him?<br><br>We both know you didn't just graze me, because an ambulance came and we both know that an ambulance don't come to the hood unless something serious is going down. Perhaps you were watching as they took me away on a stretcher-sirens blaring, lights flashing, the whole deal. If you tried to follow up with me in the newspapers the next day you were out of luck, bro, because the shooting of a thirteen-year-old black kid on the Lower East Side? That doesn't make the newspaper in a city like New York.<br><br>Since our "meeting" I have lived in cities so tiny, so rural, that this type of event would have been the lead segment on the nightly news. But not here in New York. What with Sons of Sam, Bernard Goetzes, Mafia rubouts, and the occasional bludgeoning. Now if I had been a Kennedy or a Rockefeller or even a Cosby, well that's a whole other story. But no, I was just little Jerome. I didn't warrant so much as a byline.<br><br>So I'm just curious, always have been-why did you pick me, Marcus? You may recall that there were two of us walking that night. There was me and there was my best buddy, Eric. Same age, same height, same color. Did the fact that I was wearing a bright blue and silver Dallas Cowboys jacket have anything to do with it? Probably not. Were you high? Drunk? Strung out on crack? Were you and a friend screwing around taking pot shots out of your bedroom or living room window like me and Kahlil used to do with his BB gun, aiming at the pigeons on the roof across the street? Was I your pigeon?<br><br>Maybe you never really intended to shoot me? Maybe you meant to shoot near me and just scare us, not actually hit either of us. But hey, shit happens, right? Maybe you wrongly thought I was an old friend or an enemy: local drug dealer who recently dissed you. A guy you heard slept with your woman?<br><br>I have created so many scenarios in my head it is incredible. It's a wonderful gift having a creative mind. But sometimes it can be a curse as well. I have the powerful ability to fill in all the crevices and blank spots that you left behind. I get to touch up the masterful painting that you left undone so long ago. I am van Gogh and Matisse, Baldwin and Salinger, Dylan and Lennon. I will make my own reality and place you where I choose. This is my talent. My super power.<br><br>In my thoroughness I have conceived of just about every possibility. Like the one that you, Marcus, are no longer even around anymore to read this. That perhaps, once you shot me and left me to die on that cold, hard pavement on Seventh Street and Avenue C, maybe something equally traumatic happened to you shortly thereafter. Maybe you went out to rob a grocery store and you were stabbed by the clerk behind the counter; left to die on a cold, uncaring checkered floor. Or maybe you were riding your bike that afternoon and you were hit by a taxi. Left to die in midtown traffic amid a crowd of hot dog vendors and tourists. Maybe you were busted later that week selling crack, went to Rikers, and got killed in the shower. Or in a prison riot. Or in the laundry room. Hey, maybe, just maybe, you were so riddled by guilt at realizing that you shot a helpless kid that you delved into a life of substance abuse and OD'd on heroin one cool February night. Left to die in a bathtub. Or you took a header off the roof of your building, not too far from where you shot me. Or you hung yourself in the broom closet of your day job as a junior high school janitor. I've thought of it all, over and over. It used to be all that I could do: come up with ways Marcus could die. Should die.<br><br>Truth be told, it doesn't really matter much because I didn't write this book for you, Marcus. My reasons for writing this are bigger than you or me, my friend. I wrote this book to release demons into the warm night air. I wrote this book to leave some scant history, a trail of breadcrumbs, for the children I will never have and the children that you probably have had. I wrote this book so that someone else might understand us. I wrote this book for any great number of people who believe that Life really gave them the short and shitty end of the stick. I wrote this book for all of those unfortunate suckers who were in the proverbial wrong place at the wrong time. Were we chumps or what? Or were we?<br><br>Who knows, maybe in our own way we were actually the lucky ones. Wouldn't that be a wondrous piece of irony, huh? Perhaps, by virtue of circumstance and timing, we avoided an even harsher reality. Cormac McCarthy wrote in No Country for Old Men, "You never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from." I love this perception. Maybe, just maybe, it was our destiny to be in that so-called wrong place at the wrong time. If that should be the case, then I most likely owe you a debt of gratitude, Marcus old boy. If you're still around, call me. I owe you a beer or two.<br><br>But I should reiterate, I didn't write this book for you, Marcus. I wrote this for a certain population of the world: Those who endure. Those who manage. Those who cope. Those who get out of bed every morning and continue to go on with the business of their lives knowing what they know. Those who look into the eye of the storm and step out of it battered, drenched, and unbeaten. Those who are determined to move on. Maybe you're one of us? Now that would truly make for a great story, would it not?<br><br>I hope you are one of us, Marcus, because we all deserve a second chance; that shot at redemption. In many ways, we are probably very much alike, you and I. We were both given lemons. What did you do with yours, Marcus? I, for one, chose to make a martini.<br><br>INT. LIVING ROOM IN SMALL APARTMENT-DAY<br><br>JEROME, ten, sits on the couch, sad. DOREEN sits beside him. She puts her arm around his shoulder. SUBTITLE: INTRO TO DEATH-VOLUME ONE<br><br>DOREEN<br><br>You gonna be okay?<br><br>JEROME<br><br>Yeah. I'm gonna miss her. Why did she die?<br><br>DOREEN<br><br>I don't know. Maybe we kept the windows open too much and she got cold. Maybe we put too much vitamins in her water. I don't know, son.<br><br>JEROME<br><br>She was just getting used to me, you know? She would fly around and land on my shoulder or my head. I was gonna teach her to talk. It's not fair.<br><br>DOREEN<br><br>Life is not always fair, Jerome. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. That's just the way it is.<br><br>two<br><br>So I thought we could get a few things out of the way, Marcus. I wanted to share some of my history with you so that you might have a stronger understanding of the life you affected. I want you to know what I have learned-that all actions have consequences.<br><br>I wasn't originally from that neighborhood where we first met-the Lower East Side. No, I was actually from an even worse neighborhood if you can believe that. I was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and spent the first five years of my life there. One of the most infamous people to come out of this neighborhood: Mike Tyson.<br><br>I honestly don't remember much about that area or that part of my life, I was so young then, and nothing remarkable ever happened there. I have little bits of memories that feel more like dreams. Hanging outside on the stoop watching as a man was viciously attacked by a dog that another man had unleashed on him. Playing marbles in a filthy park. My mother, Doreen, barely twenty years old, making oatmeal on the stove in a tiny, roach-infested kitchen. It was a fire in our apartment that prompted us to move to Manhattan. We arrived via a crappy welfare hotel. There were just the three of us: my mother, my younger sister, Zonnie, and myself. Along the way there were a few pets-three birds, a cat, a hamster-but they never lasted long. One thing there never was? A father. I wonder, Marcus, if your experience was similar.<br><br>For me, our new neighborhood was a wonderful change. There seemed to be more light in Manhattan, and I don't just mean streetlights. It appeared to me that the sun was more favorable to Manhattan than it was to Brooklyn. The Brooklyn I remember was gray and full of shadows. In Manhattan, the way the projects were set up, they were all arranged in a kind of circle that allowed daylight more access to us. In Brooklyn, the buildings all seemed to stalk over you like great cement scarecrows, blocking out sunlight and optimism simultaneously. It was as if the Powers That Be were saying: Such beauteous nature does not belong in such a dark and cold place as this Brooklyn. Doesn't make sense, does it? I would think that that place needed it more than any I'd ever seen. But who am I to quibble with the Powers That Be, right?<br><br>Though we had more sunlight in Manhattan, not a lot else changed aesthetically. There were still the cramped quarters, still the roaches, still the elevators reeking of urine, the staircases reeking of urine, the graffiti-strewn hallways reeking of urine, the overflowing incinerator reeking of stale smoke and days-old French toast, the usual scent of dread and poverty.<br><br>And there was always the violence. I remember one absurdly hot summer day, leaving the bodega on East Third Street when I came upon two Puerto Rican men on the corner, in each other's faces arguing, clearly high on something. The argument quickly progressed into a fistfight and before I even knew what had happened they had drawn knives. I sat there with the rest of the crowd and watched; it was as if we were all viewers at a sporting event. When the skinny guy dug his blade deep into the chubby guy's stomach the match was over. The crowd dispersed and one man lay dead on the blistering pavement. I learned a valuable lesson that afternoon: Life is fleeting. It can leave any of us at any moment of any day. Maybe you were a part of that crowd, too, Marcus? What did you take from it? It's weird, isn't it? The way we get used to certain things like violence, hostility, being the underdog.<br><br>I bet you didn't know my mother gave birth to me when she was sixteen, just a high school student. She dropped out to take care of me and had my sister two years later. My father is not anyone I have a solid memory of. His presence in my life was practically nonexistent, less a shadow than a ghost, really. What my mother saw in him I do not know. Well, he was handsome. This I know because I've seen pictures; black-and-whites of him in his navy uniform. But every man looks good in a uniform, doesn't he?<br><br>The only genuine recollection I have of him is a terribly unpleasant one. I was barely six or seven when he came knocking at the apartment door. I was alone, as I often was; my mother had a receptionist job somewhere and rather than pay a babysitter she simply entrusted me to watch my sister all day long while she pulled a nine-to-five. I was good at it, too. Except for this one particular occasion with my father and that one time I nearly burnt down the apartment with candles, nothing ever went wrong.<br><br>My father, Jerome Sr., came knocking one afternoon. When I saw the man from the black-and-white pictures staring back at me through the peephole, I just knew my mother would want me to let him in. He was the hero from the war, after all. Only he wasn't really in any war and he wasn't in a uniform anymore. Now he was in tattered clothing, a nervous twitchy energy about him. His face was stretched out and emaciated. At the time, I had no idea what a strung-out druggie was, much less the symptoms of one. When I let him in and he proceeded to tear the apartment apart looking for valuables, I knew something was amiss, so I called my mother at her job.<br><br>What occurred after th...</p><h2>Hoofbeats: Katie and the Mustang #4</h2><p><b>The fourth book in the Hoofbeats series focusing on Katie!</b><br><br>With trepidation, Katie continues Westward with the Kylers.

Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.<p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland. My extended family,(Stewart's family) were from the bayous of Louisiana...also great story tellers. When you are raised on HEARING stories.....NOT SEEING THEM, you become very good at telling stories yourself. So at the age of 41 I started putting stories that I told down on paper and did drawings to help illustrate them...I guess the rest is history.</p><p>"I have enjoyed a wonderful career of writing books for children . Who could have guessed that little girl that was having such a tough time in school would end up an illustrator and author. Children and adults alike ask me where I get my ideas...I get them from the same place that you do....MY IMAGINATION... I would guess the reason my imagination is so fertile is because I came from storytelling and, WE DID NOT OWN A T.V.!!!!!!!!!

All rights reserved.<br>"I was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1944. Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.</p><p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland. My extended family,(Stewart's family) were from the bayous of Louisiana...also great story tellers. When you are raised on HEARING stories.....NOT SEEING THEM, you become very good at telling stories yourself. So at the age of 41 I started putting stories that I told down on paper and did drawings to help illustrate them...I guess the rest is history.</p><p>"I have enjoyed a wonderful career of writing books for children . Who could have guessed that little girl that was having such a tough time in school would end up an illustrator and author. Children and adults alike ask me where I get my ideas...I get them from the same place that you do....MY IMAGINATION... I would guess the reason my imagination is so fertile is because I came from storytelling and, WE DID NOT OWN A T.V.!!!!!!!!!

He masterfully addresses educational, social, political, and religious issues that have shaped American culture. His commentary rhetorically confronts the reader to consider issues such as freedom, justice, common sense, human dignity, and moral objectivity. Piper is specifically passionate in arguing that postmodern political correctness is really nothing more than an unvarnished ploy to consolidate power among society&#39;s elites and to, thus, restrict the individual freedoms and rights of the general public.</p><p>Dr. Everett Piper has served as the fifth president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University in Bartlesville, Oklahoma since August of 2002. His credentials include a B.A. from Spring Arbor University, a M.A. from Bowling Green State University, and a Ph.D. from Michigan State University. He challenges his academic and political peers for what he calls their fallacious Orwellian duplicity of intolerant tolerance. Dr. Piper writes for numerous publications including the Examiner Enterprise, Chuck Colson&#39;s Breakpoint Magazine, and Crosswalk.com. He resides with his wife and two children in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.

Kazahaya awakens from a disturbing dream of the sister he had to part from, Kei--covered in blood and clutching him close to her. If it's a case of seeing spirits, there's one young man Kazahaya and Rikuo can go to for advice--a special guest character CLAMP fans know from <i>xxxHolic and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle</i>--Kimihiro Watanuki!</p><p>CLAMP takes its name from the farmer's term for a heap of potatoes, reflecting their origin as a self-publishing collective of fanzine artists. CLAMP went pro in 1989, and by 1993 there remained four core members: Nanase Ohkawa (main writer), Mokona (chief character designer), and Tsubaki Nekoi and Satsuki Igarashi (artists)--but like a band on different songs, the four often shift their roles depending upon the particular work. CLAMP's early shojo works such as <i>Cardcaptor Sakura</i> and <i>Magic Knight Rayearth</i> attracted the same audience as <i>Sailor Moon</i>, whereas 2001's hit <i>Chobits</i> confirmed their crossover success with male readers as well. More than a dozen of CLAMP's works have been adapted to anime, and collectively their manga have sold over 100 million copies worldwide.

W. Bush&#x2014;"Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth"&#x2014;she instantly became a media celebrity and triggered a rivalry that would alter the course of American history. In 1990, Richards won the governorship of Texas, upsetting the GOP's colorful rancher and oilman Clayton Williams. The first ardent feminist elected to high office in America, she opened up public service to women, blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans, gays, and the disabled. Her progressive achievements and the force of her personality created a lasting legacy that far transcends her rise and fall as governor of Texas.</p><p>In Let the People In, Jan Reid draws on his long friendship with Richards, interviews with her family and many of her closest associates, her unpublished correspondence with longtime companion Bud Shrake, and extensive research to tell a very personal, human story of Ann Richards's remarkable rise to power as a liberal Democrat in a conservative Republican state. Reid traces the whole arc of Richards's life, beginning with her youth in Waco, her marriage to attorney David Richards, her frustration and boredom with being a young housewife and mother in Dallas, and her shocking encounters with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter. He follows Richards to Austin and the wild 1970s scene and describes her painful but successful struggle against alcoholism. He tells the full, inside story of Richards's rise from county office and the state treasurer's office to the governorship, where she championed gun control, prison reform, environmental protection, and school finance reform, and he explains why she lost her reelection bid to George W. Bush, which evened his family's score and launched him toward the presidency. Reid describes Richards's final years as a world traveler, lobbyist, public speaker, and mentor and inspiration to office holders, including Hillary Clinton. His nuanced portrait reveals a complex woman who battled her own frailties and a good-old-boy establishment to claim a place on the national political stage and prove "what can happen in government if we simply open the doors and let the people in."</p></p><p>Jan Reid has written for Texas Monthly, Esquire, GQ, Slate, Men&#x2019;s Journal, Garden &amp; Gun, the New York Times, and many other publications. His books include The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock, The Bullet Meant for Me, Rio Grande, Texas Tornado: The Times and Music of Doug Sahm, and two award-winning novels, Deerinwater and Comanche Sundown. He lives in Austin, Texas."Jan Reid gives us new insight into Ann Richards, whose wit filled any room with laughter, whose candor chased away every smoke screen, whose heart was as big as Texas. Governor Richards was a leader you wanted to follow to a world where everyone could be a winner, and she never stopped trying to take us there. I loved her and so will you." (President Bill Clinton)<br><br>"I always felt that knowing Ann Richards was a bit like knowing a rock star. Jan Reid&#x2019;s addition to the literature, myth, and reality about Ann is a great read for Ann&#x2019;s fans and foes alike. I was sorry when we lost the great Ann Richards. I was sad when I closed this compelling book." (Liz Smith)<br><br>"At once a compelling, touching tale of a remarkable woman and an insightful account of the decline of Texas liberalism. Jan Reid captures the spirit, accomplishments, and failures of Ann Richards wonderfully well. One of the best books on Texas politics in years." (H. W. Brands)</p><h2>Opening the Field of Practical Theology: An Introduction</h2><p>Opening the Field of Practical Theology introduces students to practical theology through an examination of fifteen different approaches&#x2014;ranging from feminist to liberationist, Roman Catholic to evangelical, Asian American to Latino/a. <br><br>After an introduction to the field of practical theology and its broad range of practice today, the book features chapters written by leading experts in the discipline. Each chapter has an identical structure to facilitate comparison, covering historical context, key features and figures, norms and sources of authority, theory-practice, contexts, interdisciplinary considerations, areas of current and future research, and suggested readings.<br><br>Opening the Field of Practical Theology is an ideal introduction to the field, highlighting the diverse ways practical theology is engaged today.</p><p>Kathleen A. Cahalan is professor of theology at Saint John&#x2019;s School of Theology and a past president of the Association of Practical Theology. She is the author of several books, including Introducing the Practice of Ministry.<br> <br>Gordon S. Mikoski is associate professor of Christian Education and director of the Master&#x2019;s Studies Program at Princeton Theological Seminary. He serves as editor for Theology Today and is a past president of the Association of Practical Theology and an ordained Presbyterian minister.This valuable volume provides an introduction, 15 contextual essays, and a conclusion by experts in practical theology. The book succeeds in 'opening the field,' recognizing the discipline's provisionality and permeability as open-ended and conversational in nature. To aid comparisons, each chapter is structured with the same eight key features. These begin with historical context and proceed through themes such as norms and source of authority, views of the theory-practice relationship, interdisciplinary conversation partners, and areas of current and future research. . . .The editors identify 11 focal concerns that are characteristic of practical theology and that forge an overall unity for the field. Yet the ways practical theologians put these together result in numerous trajectories or approaches. As Stephen Bevans says, 'In practical theology one begins from an experience or a practice.' This perspective leads to the distinctive identities of the chapters, which cover practical theology as it pertains to African Americans, Evangelicals, feminists/womanists, Roman Catholics, and US Latinos/Latinas. This overview approach should be very helpful for readers at all levels. Summing Up: Recommended. Lower-level undergraduates and above; general readers. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>With the publication of Opening the Field of Practical Theology: An Introduction, Kathleen A. Cahalan and Gordon S. Mikoski have deepened and expanded the tent with a superb collection of essays. The book deepens out understanding by inviting fourteen different authors to examine common features of practical theology from diverse perspectives in an accessible and systematic way. . . .The structure is genius because it makes it possible to read the book in a number of different ways. . . .The endnotes add to the aim of this excellent new resource: they open the field of practical theology. (<i>International Journal of Practical Theology</i>)<br><br>Opening the Field of Practical Theology offers practical theology students and teachers abundant access points into studying, teaching, and engaging diverse practices. This book will be required in doctoral studies in practical theology, will support life-long reflection on ministerial practices and vocational development, and will empower collaboration among diverse practical theologians. . . .Opening the Field of Practical Theology invites readers to enter practical theology&#x2019;s convergences (named in the conclusion as valuing self-reflection, context, and interdisciplinarity) and divergences (named in the conclusion as differing interpretations of human experiences, historical contexts, and normative sources). The editors also encourage readers to play with the order of the chapters, underlying commitments, organization provided by the common template, and additional convergences and divergences. . . .[T]he volume affirms practical theology&#x2019;s robust role in formative theological study, carrying on a long-standing conversation among scholars that is itself open to new voices and perspectives. Opening the Fieldof Practical Theology provides an invaluable contribution to a field of study that has opened multiple significant future trajectories. (<i>Theology Today</i>)<br><br>Particularly noteworthy is the clear treatment given by each contributor to perhaps the most heavily-contested aspect of practical theology: the nature and status of sources of authority. Here the comparisons made possible between Catholic, Protestant, and evangelical positions, as well as the insights from a number of liberationist perspectives, will allow students to come to some necessary clarity about a key methodological question, clarity that is grounded in the voices of respected representatives of particular traditions. (<i>Anglican and Episcopal History</i>)<br><br>Opening the Field of Practical Theology maps the complex terrain of this field as astutely as anything in print. Its respectful attention to diversity of ethnic and religious contexts and appropriate methods for them is to be applauded. Happily the shared template across the contributions makes it feel like an integrated volume and not simply a collection of essays. Best of all, the authors come across as living theologians whose own stories and contexts matter. This volume not only talks about practical theology, but smartly models it. Bravo! (Edward Foley, capuchin, Catholic Theological Union)<br><br>This outstanding book demonstrates the breadth in the emerging field of Practical Theology in the U.S. Different Christian communities, related to different ethnic groups and different cultural contexts, demand for differentiated elaborations of a Practical Theology that should be both theologically normative and culturally informed. The authors paint a vivid picture of Practical Theology today. (Wilhelm Gr�b, Humboldt-University Berlin)<br><br>Whether you are just starting out in the field of practical theology, or undertaking advanced research, this book has something to offer you. It combines a comprehensive introduction with cutting-edge insights and deserves to be a staple text for many years to come. (Elaine Graham, University of Chester, United Kingdom)<br><br>Cahalan and Mikoski have provided a straightforward approach to a complex and seemingly amorphous subject. The common structure of each chapter provides a clear and eminently useful way to engage and understand the nuances within and between various understandings of and approaches to practical theology. Using rubrics that help make explicit what is often only implicit, the authors invite the reader into the dynamic interchange between lived experience and divine activities through a variety of contextual, theoretical, historical and theological lenses. (Barbara McClure, Brite Divinity School)<br><br>A wonderful bird&#x2019;s eye view of the scholarly expanse constituting practical theology today. Kudos to the insightful editors who designed a set of common categories and the stellar scholars who amplified them in overview chapters designed to help readers understand disciplinary developments. Readers will gain an invaluable sense of what counts for practical theology across a range of different approaches. (Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore, Vanderbilt University)<br><br>This new textbook offers a welcome and fresh approach to teaching and learning practical theology. Its attentiveness to the varieties of practical theological method and its use of a common template across the chapters will help students read comparatively and, thus, better comprehend the complexity of the field.

This journey is completely unique and the path veers across the martial arts, ancient healing techniques, and mysticism. Jim McMillan encounters and describes these experiences with such humility and gratitude that their incredible nature feels completely appropriate in this world and honestly possible for individuals with the authentic desire to eclipse the confines of preconceived limitations. This story serves as a challenge for individuals to both open the mind to a world of possibilities while connecting the body and soul to the energy that surrounds us. I accept this invitation and hope others will too.&#x201d; &#x2212;Peter Swanz, ND, FHANP &#x201c;Jim&#x2019;s experience of the Mo Pai is one of magic, mystery, excitement, and betrayal. The book provided me with great hope and reconciliation of the true human nature in my heart which I always subconsciously sensed. It is also an urgent call in this precarious time for people of all races to unite in finding the lost and forgotten meaning within, by becoming aware of what we really are and demanding God&#x2019;s given knowledge to be released by various powers that be, without prejudice and for the benefit of all continuing humanity.&#x201d; &#x2212;Peter Proksch, Mo Pai student</p><p></p><h2>Midnight Flight</h2><p><b>They lived on the wild side.<br> Now these bad girls are paying the price.</b> <br> At Dr. Foreman's School for Girls, the "students" sleep in barns, work on a farm in the blazing heat, and are subjected to ruthless guards who watch their every move.

Why are we in this place?" I asked.<br><br>"Why are you asking me? How would I know?" she shot back at me. "What do I look like, information please?"<br><br>"Well, you were here before me so I thought you might know more," I threw back at her with just as unfriendly a tone.<br><br>"We got here only a little while before you did," the second girl said, somewhat softer. I turned to her. "So we don't know any more than you do. I'm Teal Sommers. That's Robin Lyn Taylor. She didn't tell me her name," Teal added with a smirk. "I heard one of those girls call her that." She leaned forward to glare past me at Robin Lyn.<br><br>"I'm not exactly in a party mood, you know, and I told you, I don't like to be called Robin Lyn. Just call me Robin. You, too," she ordered me.<br><br>"Yes, Your Majesty," I said, and Teal laughed.<br><br>Robin folded her arms and turned away. "Well, we're here together so I guess we'll have to talk to each other decently. Where y'all from?"<br><br>"Where y'all from?" Teal laughed. "I'm from Albany, New York. I was flown in here just a little before y'all were, I think. I'm very unsure about the time. They took my watch."<br><br>"Mine, too," I said, rubbing my wrist. "And my ring. Why did they do that?"<br><br>"Maybe they're jewel thieves. They took Robin's watch, too, right, Robin?"<br><br>"Big deal. I stole it. I'll steal another first chance I get," she said defiantly, looking at the closed door. "I'm supposed to be at a school, a special school. That's what the judge said," she shouted at the door.

I was drugged, kidnapped, and brought here."<br><br>Robin started to laugh and stopped. "Did you say drugged and kidnapped?"<br><br>"I know exactly what she means. That's how I felt," Teal said. "My father arranged for me to be transported here. He was nice enough to tell me I was going to a special school, but my parents didn't even let me take a change of clothing. Daddy had a hired goon bring me to the airport and to the plane. Next thing I knew, I was flying away and no one told me where I was going. They kept the windows shut, too. They gave me something to drink, and before I knew it, I was asleep, so I was drugged, too. When I woke up, I was here and dressed in this rag and these stupid clodhoppers as well as this...diaper."<br><br>"I guess I shouldn't have expected anything better from my aunt, but why did your father do that to you?" I asked. Even though I had had some of my things when Daddy brought me to live with Aunt Mae Louise and Uncle Buster, I didn't feel much different except I knew why they'd got rid of me. There was no surprise for me there.<br><br>"He was, I guess I can safely say, at the end of his patience with me. I was an embarrassment to my mother, who sits at the head of the social table of high society."<br><br>"What did you do?"<br><br>"I robbed a bank," Teal muttered.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"I stole money from Daddy's secret safe, his and my brother Carson's."<br><br>"And your own father sent you away for that?"<br><br>"Well, it was a little more, I guess," Teal admitted.<br><br>"I bet," Robin muttered. "Don't be fooled by her sweet little face."<br><br>I turned to her. "What about you?"<br><br>"I didn't rob a bank, but I was part of an armed robbery of a supermarket where I worked," Robin said, looking ahead. It was as if she were reminding herself and not telling us. "This is supposed to be an alternative to going to a real jail. My mother darling talked me into it, and like both of you, I was eventually put in a plane and the same things happened to me. I fell asleep and they took my clothing and brought me here."<br><br>She smiled and shook her head and then shouted at the closed door, "They're just trying to frighten us with all this...this horror-hotel stuff, but it doesn't scare me! Y'all just wasting your time! You might as well give me back my clothes!"<br><br>"What brought you here?" Teal asked me after Robin's screams died down.<br><br>"I ran away from my uncle and aunt where I was supposed to stay."<br><br>"So, big deal," Robin said. "I bet we've all done that one time or another."<br><br>"I was supposed to be in court for hitting this boy with a little brass statue."<br><br>"Did you kill him?" Teal asked, her eyes widening with interest.<br><br>"No, but I put him in the hospital. He was part of a group of boys trying to rape me."<br><br>"So why would they put you in jail for that?" Robin asked skeptically. "It just sounds like self-defense to me."<br><br>"There's more to it."<br><br>"I bet."<br><br>"Look," I said, turning on her, "I don't have to defend myself to you. In fact -- "<br><br>Before I could say anything else, we heard the door squeal open, followed by the machine-gun <i>rat-ta-tat-tat</i> of stiletto high heels on the concrete floor.<br><br>Out of the dark shadows came a tall, elegant-looking woman, statuesque with a firm figure in a ruby-red skirt suit. She had highlighted golden brown hair, about the base of her neck in length, neatly styled. As she moved more into the light and drew closer, I saw she was an attractive woman with high cheekbones and a perfect nose. She was wearing a soft red lipstick, very understated. A girlfriend of mine, Louella Mason, who was determined to become a beautician, had told me when a woman wants to emphasize her eyes, she de-emphasizes her lips, but this woman looked like she didn't need anything special to make her eyes prominent. They weren't big as much as they were striking and intense.<br><br>She paused, looked at the three of us, and smiled so warmly, I felt like getting up and rushing into her arms. It was a smile that brought a ray of sunshine to a rainy day, and, boy, did I need some sugar now.<br><br>"Hello, girls," she said. "I'm Dr. Foreman. Welcome to my school."<br><br>"This is a school?" Teal piped up immediately. "It's more like someone's filthy basement."<br><br>Dr. Foreman turned to her and, holding her smile, said, "No, this isn't the actual school." She looked about and smiled as if she didn't see what we saw. She saw a beautiful lobby or something instead. "This is my orientation center. The school is some distance from here, but I like to meet my girls as soon as they are brought and introduce them to the way things will be as soon as possible. That way, if they don't accept what I say and don't do what I say, I can put them right back on the plane and ship them somewhere else where a far worse fate awaits them. Is this plan all right with you, Teal?"<br><br>I could see Teal was both impressed and intimidated that Dr. Foreman already knew which of us she was. Teal didn't answer. She just sat looking at her, her mouth slightly open. Dr. Foreman did not turn away immediately either. She held Teal's gaze, froze that now cold smile on her lips, and only after a few beats, slowly turned back to Robin and me.<br><br>"Now then, as I was saying, welcome to my school," she continued.<br><br>As if that was their cue, three young women, the one who had escorted me from the plane to the concrete building, and two others dressed similarly with their hair cut identically short, entered and took position just behind Dr. Foreman. They stood with military posture, their arms behind them, hands clasped, and looked forward, not at us, just forward and poised like guard dogs ready to pounce upon command. Foreman's rottweilers, all teeth and muscle, I thought.<br><br>"I created my school only five years ago, but I have, shall we say, graduated dozens of girls like you, releasing them back into society as productive young women, all of whom have kept out of any trouble with their families or with the law. Three are in fact law officers now themselves," Dr. Foreman said, smiling wider with pride. "Two are correction officers and one is a policewoman in a big city."<br><br>"Something for us to look forward to," Robin muttered. "A career as a policewoman."<br><br>Dr. Foreman looked straight ahead, but her body began to turn as if it were robotic, slowly, stiffly, her shoulders firm and straight.<br><br>"Right now, Robin Lyn Taylor, all you have to look forward to is getting yourself into more trouble and so deeply that you are eventually put away in a room without any hope of getting out. In effect, you have no future. The reason you have been sent here is to help you regain one. Until that happens, you, all of you," Dr. Foreman said, looking at Teal and me as well now, "are nonentities. You don't exist for your families. You don't exist for yourselves. All you've accomplished up until now is sharpened yourselves as thorns in the side of civilized society. With me, under my care, you will either develop the ability to have a future or you will be pulled out of the side of the civilized world and discarded like any nuisance. The choice is ultimately yours to make, but," she said, smiling warmly again, "we will do our best here to help you make the right choice. In the past, whenever you were given the opportunity to do what was right and decent, you all made other choices. We expect to correct that. We will help you.<br><br>"Someone, thanks to the mercy of our court system, has decided to give you this one last chance. Rather than sit here sulking and trying to think of wisecracks, you should begin to show some appreciation.<br><br>"But," she continued in a sweet, melodic tone, "I am the first to recognize that you are all here because you are all filled with defiance, anger, and most of all fear."<br><br>"Fear?" I muttered. I couldn't help it. It just slipped out between my lips. How could fear have brought us here?<br><br>"Yes, my dear Phoebe, fear. Antisocial behavior stems from a well of fear. You act out because you are defensive, slightly paranoid, I'm afraid. In your present way of thinking, the world around you threatens you. You believe everyone is against you and you're just naturally antagonistic to everything."<br><br>I guess she saw the lack of understanding in my face. She smiled, again so softly, I felt I could relax and listen to her for hours.<br><br>"Don't worry about any of that yet, my dear. You'll see. You'll all see. That's what's so wonderful about my work," she said excitedly, "at least to me, especially the way it opens the eyes of my girls. For me," she said, her voice rising an octave, "there is nothing as satisfying as seeing one of my girls suddenly come to the realization she can be as good as anyone else out there, she can be productive and worthwhile. She can make friends and be liked and like others. Her heart can hold sunshine, even on rainy days."<br><br>She did make it sound wonderful. For a moment she paused with her face so radiant and full of happiness, I felt some hope seep into my hardened and crusty surface. She looked at me as if she could sense it and gave me a special nod, a little more of her smile.<br><br>"People are always asking me, 'Dr. Foreman, you were a successful and renowned college professor. Why did you throw away your classroom work, your publications, your lectures, put all your fortune into this school, and go off and surround yourself with the hardest sort of challenge: girls whom everyone has given up on, girls who would easily end up in penal institutions?'<br><br>"Well, the answer is you, my dears," she declared with her arms out as though she were about to embrace all three of us at once, "you and your awakening. Nothing is more satisfying to me than to bring someone back from the dead," she continued, her right hand over her heart, "for that is where you are now, in some cemetery of your own making, burying yourselves in your disgust, your fears, your dysfunction."<br><br>She grew stern looking again and took another step toward the three of us.<br><br>"Within the next twenty-four hours, fourteen hundred teenagers like yourselves will attempt suicide, twenty-eight hundred will get pregnant, fifteen thousand will try alcohol for the first time, and thirty-five hundred will run away from home."<br><br>She let those facts linger in the air between us for a moment. I glanced at Robin and then Teal. Neither seemed impressed nor seemed to care.<br><br>"But not you. No, not my girls. To me," Dr. Foreman said, looking up at the ceiling as if she could look right through to the heavens, "you will all be like Lazarus, rising from the grave."<br><br>"Does that mean you're God?" Teal asked, her mouth dripping with sarcasm.<br><br>I thought I was brave and tough, but this soft, pretty white girl who sounded like she had been born with a silver spoon in her mouth was sure nasty and unafraid, even after all that had been done to her, to us.<br><br>Dr. Foreman's eyelids fluttered. She had what seemed unflappable poise. That smile never faltered as she lowered her gaze at Teal like someone lowering the barrel of a cannon at a new target.<br><br>"For you and for the others, dear Teal, as long as you are here, that is exactly who I will be."<br><br>She waited a moment for her words to settle. Teal shook her head and looked away.<br><br>"Now," Dr. Foreman said, turning back to speak to all of us, "let me begin by explaining that you're not going to a school any way like the ones you have attended. First, my school is at my ranch. It's a working ranch and you will all participate in the daily chores."<br><br>"Oh, so we're really a form of cheap labor, is that it?" Robin complained.<br><br>"Hardly cheap, Robin. For your work, you will be given full room and board."<br><br>"Isn't my father paying you?" Teal fired at her. "I shouldn't have to do any daily chores," she declared staunchly, her eyes burning with arrogance.<br><br>"Yes, in your case, the family is paying, but there is much more that will be given to you than you would get anywhere else for that amount of money," Dr. Foreman said calmly. The arrows and darts Teal shot at her with those fiery eyes seemed to bounce off an invisible wall of protection that surrounded her.<br><br>"Like what?" Teal demanded, refusing to step back. I saw how the girls behind Dr. Foreman glared at Teal. They all looked eager to get their hands around her neck and shake her head off her body.<br><br>"Like my expert treatment, my therapy sessions, my proven techniques," Dr. Foreman said to all of us and not just Teal. "It's off the charts when you start computing the costs, and even Teal here, who points out that her parents are paying the tuition, couldn't really afford the tuition if it were equated with the value you will all receive."<br><br>"Why are you so nice and generous to us?" Teal muttered, the corners of her mouth folding in.<br><br>"Why? I do this because I want to give back to the science that has been so good to me, as well as my deep desire to help young women in desperate need, to help them find what is spiritually good in them."<br><br>"Oh, brother," Teal muttered. "We're in a nunnery."<br><br>Dr. Foreman's rottweilers moved restlessly. She glanced at them and turned back to us.<br><br>"To continue" -- Dr. Foreman glared at Teal -- "at my school you will not find a staff of teachers to coddle and prod you into doing your homework, studying properly, and achieving. I will assign you all your work and you will have to master it all yourselves."<br><br>"Huh?" Robin said. "Did you say ourselves?"<br><br>"What are we going to study, basket weaving?" Teal asked with a crooked smile.<br><br>"You will be studying regular academic subjects, of course. We want you to qualify for high school graduat...</p><h2>Greek Art (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;One of the very best short histories of Greek Art.&#x201d; <em>&#x2015; The Financial Times</em></strong></p><p>John Boardman, one of the best known and acknowledged scholars of the classical Greek world, has updated his definitive survey of its arts, the most influential and widely known historic artistic tradition of the Old World. In the twenty years since the last edition was released, valuable evidence has come to light which has dramatically enhanced our understanding of the arts of ancient Greece and their influence.</p><p>It is now known that Greek artists completed their stone sculptures with realistic color, as well as working with a wealth of other materials. This proves that the romantic notion of an age of classic, pure white marble is a Renaissance construction which has persisted to the present day. The work of individual artists, as well as schools of artists, can be identified, creating a clearer picture than ever before of how art and artistic traditions traveled throughout the Greek world and beyond it.</p><p>Boardman encourages the reader to consider the masterpieces that have been preserved in their original context. He weaves into his discussion of the arts insights into the society that produced them. Illustrated in full color throughout for the first time, this fifth edition demonstrates yet more vividly the artistic aims and achievements of ancient Greece.</p> 311 color illustrations</p><p>John Boardman, Lincoln Professor Emeritus of Classical Archaeology and Art at Oxford University, has written widely on the art and archaeology of ancient Greece. His previous books include The Greeks Overseas, The History of Greek Vases, The World of Ancient Art, and others.&#x201c;[<em>Greek Art</em>&#x2019;s] strength lies in that it dispels old, incorrect, and widely held notions dating from the time of the European Renaissance about Greek art... The attention to detail that Boardman imparts to each facet of ancient Greek art will further facilitate an enhanced and enriched discussion about the culture and society that produced some of the world&#x2019;s most iconic and beloved works of art in and outside classrooms.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Ancient History Encyclopedia</em></strong></p><h2>The Last Closet: The Dark Side of Avalon</h2><p><p>Marion Zimmer Bradley was a bestselling science fiction author, a feminist icon, and was awarded the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement.

Within these pages I&#x2019;ve included my tricks, gimmicks, aces up my sleeves, and sales secrets, but I feel it&#x2019;s important to underline something before you get started. Success takes hard work, research, knowledge, and commitment, but the real victory comes through honesty, transparency, and being true to your word. That&#x2019;s what makes a <i>truly</i> successful person.</p><p>The subtitle of this book is <i>The Secrets of Selling Anything to Anyone</i>, but I want to point out that some things in life are not for sale: your loved ones, your children, your pets, your values, your integrity, your beliefs, your spirituality. It&#x2019;s not only that they are priceless. They are <i>sacred</i>. As a super salesman, it&#x2019;s important to remind myself that not even I can sell certain things, especially my soul. Everything else is negotiable.</p><p>&#x2014;Fredrik</p><p></p><p></p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>The first time I met Fredrik Eklund was poolside atop the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills. I was in Hollywood shooting an episode of ABC&#x2019;s <i>Shark Tank</i>, and Fredrik was on the roof attracting attention. I can spot a great salesperson from across the street and certainly from across the pool. Fredrik has magnetism that&#x2019;s impossible to miss. At the time, I didn&#x2019;t know who he was (it was before <i>Million Dollar Listing</i> <i>New York</i>), but I did know one thing: He was a success. Fredrik Eklund has that killer instinct.</p><p>When I started my NYC real estate firm in 1973 with a $1,000 loan from a boyfriend, I had no experience in sales and no doubt that I&#x2019;d be successful. Back then there weren&#x2019;t any female-owned real estate firms in the city. It was a business worked by women and <i>owned</i> by men. I wasn&#x2019;t welcome, but I certainly got noticed. From wearing my short skirts and bright colors to calling my sales team the &#x201c;Power Brokers,&#x201d; I created my reality&#x2014;that I was <i>the best seller in the city</i>. And what happened? In 1999, the Corcoran Group became the number one residential real estate company in New York City.</p><p>Fredrik, a Swede with no contacts and no real estate license, came to America, and, in less than a dozen years, leads the number one real estate sales team in the nation. Now that&#x2019;s the American dream. How&#x2019;d he do it? He knew that perception creates reality, and he had the courage to spot and seize opportunity.</p><p>The number one trait I always looked for when I was hiring someone for my company and what I look for now when I&#x2019;m investing in entrepreneurs on <i>Shark Tank</i> is passion, a <i>need</i> to succeed. Someone who&#x2019;d rather die than not be the best. That&#x2019;s Fredrik, and after reading this book, that will be you, too.</p><p>Like any great salesperson, Fredrik is very persuasive. For example, bragging about him in this foreword wasn&#x2019;t enough. He even talked me into giving you my five personal beliefs about becoming a success, all of which are included in his secrets to selling anything:</p><p><b>1. People want to do business with someone they like. </b>Don&#x2019;t ever be fooled into thinking that a job is only about the product. It&#x2019;s not. Business is all about the people. If people like you, they&#x2019;re going to want to work with you. And if they don&#x2019;t, you&#x2019;re going to have an almost insurmountable obstacle to overcome. Your job is to make them like you.</p><p><b>2. Selling is nothing more than playing up the good and playing down the bad.</b> If knowing how to do this comes naturally to you, you&#x2019;ve got a head start. If you don&#x2019;t, you can learn. When I worked in a diner, I was up against another waitress to attract customers. All the men wanted to sit with her because she had big breasts. And, well, I <i>don&#x2019;t</i>. It was my mom who gave me my best sales (and life) advice. She told me to forget about what I didn&#x2019;t have, and use what I did have&#x2014;a nice personality, a great smile, and the gift of gab&#x2014;to get customers to want to sit in my section. I packed them in! Maximize the positive; minimize the negative.</p><p><b>3. Every successful person knows how to fail well. </b>Successful people get knocked down like everyone else, but they take less time getting back up and back out there. Did you know the lowest rate of suicide is among commission salespeople? Why? Because they deal with so many rejections on a daily basis, they are more adept at handling life&#x2019;s hard knocks.</p><p><b>4. Everybody wants what everybody wants. </b>This is the basic psychology of sales. Your task is to figure out how to make people think that what you&#x2019;ve got to offer is the best thing since hot dogs and baseball. Two things to remember: More than one buyer creates urgency, and when people are told they can&#x2019;t have something, they want it all the more.</p><p><b>5. The most successful people believe their success is only temporary. </b>Top producers end each year convinced they&#x2019;ll never have another year as good. Their own track record becomes their biggest competition. In great successes, fear breeds accomplishment.</p><p>For twenty-five years I managed New York&#x2019;s top sellers, and I know how hard successful people work to keep their trade secrets. So, why would you give it all away when you&#x2019;re number one? Why would you create thousands of new successful high-kickers? Let it be known: I think Fredrik is nuts for sharing his secrets, but I suppose a real success isn&#x2019;t afraid of competition. He thrives on it.</p><p>I leave you in good hands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and on the road to making millions.</p><p>&#x2014;Barbara Corcoran</p><p>Bestselling author of <i>Shark Tales: How I Turned $1,000 into a Billion Dollar Business</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>Make &#x2019;Em Want What You&#x2019;ve Got</p><p>I became a salesman when I was seven years old. I was living in Stockholm, where I was born, and I signed up with a company I heard about through school to sell Christmas calendars and books. Those who sold the most each week would win a waterproof, yellow Sony Walkman. (Remember those?) I decided I didn&#x2019;t just want to sell a lot; I wanted to be the number one seller among the thousands of kids selling Christmas calendars in Sweden. I was going to sell more than <i>anyone</i>!</p><p>My goal made me obsessed. I went to bed every night, and, like a prisoner counting the days on his jail-cell wall, I charted on the wallpaper of my room a matrix-like plan to world-calendar-sales domination. When my dad came across my scribbles, he was <i>arg</i>! (That&#x2019;s Swedish for <i>angry</i>!) But it was too late! The writing was literally on the wall: I was on my way to becoming the biggest seller.</p><p>Every morning, I put on my favorite sweater my grandmother had hand-knitted for me, with two reindeers on the front, loaded all the catalogs on a sled, and went knocking door-to-door, schlepping my wares through the snow into Akalla, a suburb north of Stockholm. I knew the market because it was my neighborhood. A million homes were built there during the 1970s, and many retired people had moved in. The old ladies were my favorite targets, a captive audience for a friendly kid with a selling smile. I&#x2019;d knock on their doors and take a step back so that when they answered, I&#x2019;d be perfectly positioned to look up at them so they could notice my cute sweater. I&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Hi. It&#x2019;s me, Fredrik. It&#x2019;s nice to see you again.&#x201d; Almost always, they&#x2019;d invite me in. I became the grandson who was finally visiting. I sat with them and talked, talked, talked and sold, sold, sold. I made them <i>want </i>to buy a calendar from me.</p><p>The result? I drank a lot of green tea that winter, listened to more than my fair share of World War II stories, and broke all records for the calendar company. And I really mean <i>all</i> records. I even got a letter from the president of the company asking what my secret was. (But I kept the secrets for this book and am sending him a signed copy as my answer, exactly thirty years later!) I also won so many Walkmans that I sold them, too&#x2014;to my classmates at school!</p><p>Today I use the same technique I used on the Swedish grannies when I&#x2019;m showing million-dollar properties to Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Timberlake, Daniel Craig, or a family from the Upper West Side, and convincing them the time to buy is <i>now</i>&#x2014;from <i>me</i>.</p><p>But you don&#x2019;t have to work on commission to benefit from my selling strategies. Because let me tell you something: You&#x2019;ve been in sales your whole life, even if you haven&#x2019;t realized it. Have you been on a date where you dressed your best and turned on the charm? You were selling. Have you asked someone to take out the trash because you were tired and didn&#x2019;t want to? You were selling. Have you interviewed for a job? You were selling. That&#x2019;s why <i>The Sell </i>is for everyone. It describes all of the sales each of us make every day, even if our job title isn&#x2019;t &#x201c;salesperson.&#x201d; Regardless of the industry you&#x2019;re in&#x2014;Christmas calendars, Internet, real estate, baking, motherhood&#x2014;understand this right here, right now: It&#x2019;s <i>all the same</i>. <i>If you know how to sell</i> you<i>, you know how to sell anything</i>. Whether you&#x2019;re selling medical equipment to a doctor or an early bedtime to your third grader, The Sell is a daily event in everyone&#x2019;s life.</p><p>What do sellers do? They persuade, influence, and convince someone to give them something in exchange for what they&#x2019;ve got. How is that different from trying to convince your boss to support your idea? Or trying to talk your husband into going on a vacation to Tahiti when he&#x2019;d rather go to Tokyo? Anytime we want someone to do something, we are putting The Sell into action. We sell a smile to get the better table in a restaurant, a kind remark to get our way with customer service, and sincerity to form long-lasting friendships. That is selling. Whether it is a car buyer&#x2019;s money, a coworker&#x2019;s help, your teenager&#x2019;s attention, or a best friend&#x2019;s guidance, realizing how to motivate someone into taking action is The Sell.</p><p>Are people buying what you&#x2019;re selling?</p><p>Are they buying <i>you</i>?</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>A decade ago, I moved to New York City from Sweden with a pair of sneakers and a dream: to make it to the top in the city that never sleeps. I didn&#x2019;t have a clue then as to how I&#x2019;d actually make that happen or even what my career path would be, but I absolutely believed I would be the best. I believed in the only product I had: <i>me</i>. In my fairy tale, I knew that one day, regardless of the industry I chose, I&#x2019;d be the king of New York. I visualized headlines, glamour, and a wallet stuffed with hundred-dollar bills. I knew it wasn&#x2019;t going to be easy in the most cutthroat city in the world, but I was ready for the battle.</p><p>My story began in the suburbs of Stockholm, Sweden. That&#x2019;s Sv<i>eeee</i>den, wedged between Norway and Finland in Northern Europe and far away from big and glitzy Manhattan. Yes, it&#x2019;s very cold and dark in the winters, and, no, it is not Switzerland. (I&#x2019;ve discovered a lot of Americans confuse the two.) And there are no ice bears (I&#x2019;m told you call them polar bears) roaming around the streets, just a bunch of tall, blond people with blue eyes who love vodka, dancing the frog dance on Midsummer&#x2019;s Eve (intoxicated by the former), building safe cars, designing low-cost furniture that you put together yourself, rolling out stores with inexpensive clothes all over the world, and writing catchy pop music you love to hate (or hate to love).</p><p>We didn&#x2019;t have a lot of money when I was young, but my parents always made sure we got to travel. When I was ten years old, my father, Klas Eklund, a Swedish economist, unknowingly changed the course of my life. He had been invited to give a speech in New York City and exchanged the first-class ticket he had received for three economy tickets and brought my older brother, Sigge, and me with him.</p><p>Even as I am writing this, I still remember the yellow cab picking us up outside JFK Airport, the reggae music on the radio, the almost tropical heat as I rolled the window down in the backseat and dropped my head outside to see the approaching skyline.</p><p>I am sitting there again now, ten years old, and you are sitting next to me. Are you with me?</p><p>Feel the hot vinyl seat; roll down the window; smell that humid, sweet, and hopeful autumn air of 1987 New York. We are on this journey together, you and me.</p><p>The city&#x2019;s energy, excitement, and vertical living instantly hooked me. There was also a dark side to Gotham that I loved. I could smell the danger. At dusk, the cab took us through Times Square with its neon fireworks, and my jaw dropped. I could see the poor, the rich, and the gaps in between. The thousands of tourists with cameras signaled that <i>this</i> was the center of the universe. I believe there are certain impressions in life that are so strong they are etched into the neurons of your brain forever and actually change that chemical soup permanently. This was one of those moments. The second was my first commission check. The third was falling in love, and I hope seeing the face of my newborn daughter will someday be one, too.</p><p>My father, Sigge, and I climbed to the top of the Statue of Liberty, and I got to see her perspective of the glimmering city across the water, a beehive of excitement. There is a photo of me up in her crown, looking out, and you can see in my eyes how awestruck I was. I had the vision of my liberation. I decided right then and there that I would become one with the city. I would become very successful, but more important, someone who was following his dreams.</p><p>I often think that until this moment, our family had been my little solar system. My brother and I were the planets orbiting the sun, our family home back in Stockholm. But suddenly the laws of gravitation were bent, perhaps because I saw another sun through the windows of the Statue of Liberty: New York. This sun symbolized a new goal: freedom, success, and the ultimate sell.</p><p>As we ferried back to shore, the rain came down hard and we had to run without cover from the boat in the Financial District just south of the Twin Towers to hide in a steakhouse with red leather seats and cigarette smoke<i>. Just like the movies</i>, I thought. <i>I</i> will<i> come back here. I will live here one day! I will create my own life.</i></p><p>Fifteen years later, when I realized that dream and moved to Manhattan, I instantly felt at home and that anything was possible. New York was magical to me, and it still is. Just walking down Fifth Avenue in the heat of the summer makes my heart race with excitement. It is empowering to look up at the skyscrapers, watching them defy gravity and reaching&#x2014;like all the dreamers in this city&#x2014;higher and higher.</p><p>I moved with a few Swedish friends into a one-bedroom rental apartment on Thirty-Seventh Street in midtown across from Macy&#x2019;s. I didn&#x2019;t know anyone in New York, but we Swedes felt a certain companionship in our proud but naive attempt to leave Sweden and not look back. I did miss my family, but my drive to make it in my new hometown was stronger. I kept thinking that the only time to create my future self was now. Not tomorrow.

That nearly all of her ideas&#x2015;that women are entitled to seek an education, to own property, to get a divorce, and to vote&#x2015;are now commonplace is in large part because she worked tirelessly to extend the nation's promise of radical individualism to women.</p><p>In this subtly crafted biography, the historian Lori D. Ginzberg narrates the life of a woman of great charm, enormous appetite, and extraordinary intellectual gifts who turned the limitations placed on women like herself into a universal philosophy of equal rights. Few could match Stanton's self-confidence; loving an argument, she rarely wavered in her assumption that she had won. But she was no secular saint, and her positions were not always on the side of the broadest possible conception of justice and social change. Elitism runs through Stanton's life and thought, defined most often by class, frequently by race, and always by intellect. Even her closest friends found her absolutism both thrilling and exasperating, for Stanton could be an excellent ally and a bothersome menace, sometimes simultaneously. At once critical and admiring, Ginzberg captures Stanton's ambiguous place in the world of reformers and intellectuals, describes how she changed the world, and suggests that Stanton left a mixed legacy that continues to haunt American feminism.</p></p><p><p>A professor of history and women's studies at Pennsylvania State University, <b>Lori D. Ginzberg</b> has written several books on women's history, including <i>Untidy Origins: A </i><i>Story of Woman's Rights in Antebellum New York</i>. She lives in Philadelphia.</p>1 THE TWO WORLDS <br>OF ELIZABETH CADY <br>(1815&#x2013;1840) To hear Elizabeth Cady Stanton tell it, Johnstown, New York, where she was born in 1815, was a place of comfort and con�vention, privilege and patriarchy. Her parents, Daniel and Mar�garet Livingston Cady, were devoted to family, tradition, and the Federalist Party. They were strict and stodgy, and their children were raised according to old-fashioned norms of childhood, religion, class&#x2014;and, especially, gender. Church, school, and family taught only &#x201c;that everlasting no! no! no!&#x201d; and conspired to enforce &#x201c;the constant cribbing and crippling of a child&#x2019;s life.&#x201d; It struck the young Elizabeth Cady that &#x201c;everything we like to do is a sin, and . . . everything we dis�like is commanded by God or someone on earth.&#x201d; Only with her sister Margaret&#x2019;s complicity was she able to get over her &#x201c;infantile fear of punishment&#x201d; in order to have fun.1 It was a perfect setting against which to rebel, and, as Elizabeth Cady Stanton recalled fondly, she rebelled with gusto. <br>Provincial it was, but the world of Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x2019;s birth, while it seemed only to reinforce the traditional, pastoral life her father enjoyed, was far from static. The inhabitants of the town, an 1824 gazetteer reported, &#x201c;seem to be very industrious and intent on keeping pace, in every improvement, with the progress of things around them&#x201d; and, indeed, Johnstown was a local center for the industrial changes that had skirted other small towns. The nation&#x2019;s .rst glove and mitten factory had been founded there, in about 1808, and manufacturing was at the heart of Johnstown&#x2019;s economy; the very air of Stanton&#x2019;s childhood must have smelled of progress.2 Nor was the local elite of long standing. The family and Episcopal church con�gregation of Johnstown&#x2019;s founder, Sir William Johnson, all Loyalists, had left for Canada after the Revolution, leaving an open door for the likes of Daniel Cady. <br>For all their sense of established respectability and community leadership, the Cadys were, like most white residents of Upstate New York, new blood. Daniel Cady had been born in Columbia County in 1773, studied law in Albany, and moved the forty miles to Johnstown in 1798. Margaret Livingston, a dozen years his junior, had been born in the Hudson Valley to Revolutionary War hero James Livingston and his wife, Elizabeth Simpson Livingston. Although their own Elizabeth believed that the laws, norms, and values that structured men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s lives in her childhood were unchanging and unchallenged, Daniel and Margeret Cady had already seen changes of various kinds. Not all of these were progressive in nature. Churches that had shown some openness to women&#x2019;s speech in the mid-eighteenth century were, by the early nineteenth, reasserting traditional forms of male authority. Near Margaret Cady&#x2019;s birthplace, Dutch traditions that had given married women greater property rights had been largely super�seded by more stringent English common law that declared the whole of a woman&#x2019;s inherited property her husband&#x2019;s. Even in politics, the barriers of sex had been less rigid, less seemingly absolute, in 1800 than they would be during Elizabeth Cady&#x2019;s youth. In New Jersey, women who owned property could vote until 1807, when the legisla�ture restricted suffrage to white men, re.ecting a growing consensus that women had no role in political life. Indeed, the Revolution itself, while underscoring the political equality of greater numbers of white men, saw a narrowing of elite women&#x2019;s conventional access to public authority. Daniel Cady, stubbornly conservative, wished to hold on to what authority he had gained (cultural, familial, political, and eco�nomic) as long as possible.3 <br>Historians tend to mark 1815, the end of the War of 1812, and the year of Elizabeth Cady&#x2019;s birth, as the start of a new era in American history. It was a time that would, before too long, seethe with changes in law, religion, trade, politics, transportation, class structures, and, of course, ideas about women. Vast changes would take place that the Cadys could not possibly imagine or predict. Indeed, among Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x2019;s generation of Americans would be the .rst women to attend college, once Oberlin formally admitted them in 1837; the .rst female doctors, once sisters Emily and Elizabeth Blackwell earned their medical degrees; and an astonishing array of female speakers, antislavery reformers, writers, editors, labor activists, educators, and, of course, advocates of woman suffrage. <br>But before imagining the change that would occur, consider the world, and the rules, into which these women, citizens of the United States, were born. In 1830, when Elizabeth Cady was .fteen, the common-law notion of coverture&#x2014;that is, the idea that wives were &#x201c;covered&#x201d; by their husbands&#x2019; protection&#x2014;virtually de.ned the laws of marriage. Once they married, women could not own or inherit prop�erty, sign a contract, or pursue their business interests in court. Although women tended to bear somewhat fewer children than they had a century earlier, childbearing was still frequent and deadly. Legal divorce, as opposed to less formal desertion, was rare, and custody of minor children went to the husband, who essentially &#x201c;owned&#x201d; their labor. The opportunities for middle- and upper-class women to live independently of men&#x2014;whether husbands, fathers, or brothers&#x2014; were few indeed, and it would not be until the very late nineteenth century that signi.cant numbers of them could do so. Unmarried women paid taxes just as men did, but they could not vote for the rep�resentatives who set their tax rates or give advice about how those taxes were spent. Women could not serve on a jury, though they were tried often enough for crimes; nor could they speak out about such crimes in most religious assemblies. They were barred both from men&#x2019;s colleges and from a wide array of occupations&#x2014;and not surpris�ingly, those they dominated, such as domestic service and prostitu�tion, were among the lowest paid. In cities, new commercial markets presented both opportunities and pitfalls for women; they ran shops and small manufactories, operated millinery businesses, opened schools, and did the grueling work that the growing upper classes expected of seamstresses, servants, and nursemaids. But if these enterprising women married, their wages were no longer their own, but their husbands&#x2019;. Over the next century, much of this&#x2014;.rst and mostly among the upper and middle classes&#x2014;would change. In the meantime, for all the rhetoric about the common man, Elizabeth Cady&#x2019;s world was in many respects characterized by greater restric�tion, reinforced hierarchies, and frequent declarations that what America needed was more stability and tradition, not less. <br>The Cadys, who married in 1801, when Margaret was sixteen, .ourished in Johnstown and in this larger world, living in a large house on a corner of Main Street. Aided by his ties to Margaret&#x2019;s brother-in-law, the fabulously wealthy Peter Smith, Daniel Cady established himself as a lawyer, landowner, state legislator, and judge. In the year of Elizabeth&#x2019;s birth, his neighbors elected him to Con�gress, where he served one term. The couple had eleven children, of whom only six would survive childhood; the only son among those, Eleazar, would die at twenty. <br>The Cady family&#x2019;s economic privilege and social authority are nearly invisible threads running through Stanton&#x2019;s recollections, unquestioned and, to Stanton, unproblematic. It was, rather, her fa�ther&#x2019;s intransigence about gender that formed the core of the story Elizabeth Cady Stanton told about her childhood. Her most vivid, and oft-repeated, story was that of a brilliant, boisterous, rebellious little girl, eleven years old, whose only living brother, Eleazar, had just died. How dark the household must have seemed. Distraught, she crawled into her father&#x2019;s lap, seeking to give and receive comfort. But her grieving, distracted father put his arm around her and sighed, &#x201c;Oh, my daughter, I wish you were a boy!&#x201d; The sting of the father&#x2019;s remark, whether spiteful or unfeeling or simply careless, lingers. Every girl who has yearned to impress an accomplished or demanding father, every woman who has felt the slight of being thought less promising than her brothers, can relate to the insult. Elizabeth Cady, as it turned out, had more than enough reserves of self-esteem to survive the slap, though she never forgot it; not only was she as brilliant as the boys and men around her, but she knew it. She was, as one historian puts it, &#x201c;singularly unaf.icted with psychological insecurity,&#x201d; and she quickly put her extraordinary self-con.dence to work.4 The child, as the woman later recalled, vowed to make her father happy by being all a son could have been, thus providing a rationale for her grand ambi�tions. But the political moral that she took from this childhood affront was the germ of something even larger: her recognition that society&#x2019;s preference for and pride in boys dwarfed girls&#x2019; lives, limited their opportunities, and were used to justify the denial of woman&#x2019;s rights. She took this insult very personally indeed. <br>Is it possible to sympathize, however grudgingly, with Judge Cady? There is every evidence that he loved his daughters, and even in sigh�ing over the limitations of Elizabeth&#x2019;s sex, he surely knew that this one was especially bright. But the man had just lost his only living son, at an age when the young man&#x2019;s promise was evident but his path not clearly marked, and at a time when a man such as the judge could reasonably rest his ambitions for succession only on boys. Surely he envisioned Eleazar, who had just graduated from Union College, fol�lowing in his footsteps, perhaps joining him in the law of.ce or at court. It is possible to read Daniel Cady&#x2019;s comment to his daughter not simply as a putdown, though it surely was that, but also as an acknowledgment that her intellect and her wit would in fact have found more expansive arenas if she had been a boy. Elizabeth&#x2019;s father was neither so wrong nor uniquely old-fashioned in feeling a twinge of regret that this gifted child was a girl, for in the judge&#x2019;s world, and pretty much everyplace else, the barriers that limited her sex were real indeed. <br>To hear Stanton tell it, she spent her girlhood days trying to impress her learned father, live up to the standards set by her brother, and learn from the law students who wandered through the house. That the household was not composed exclusively of men seems largely to have escaped her notice. There is little of Margaret Liv�ingston Cady in her daughter&#x2019;s account, and her appearances are gen�erally fairly passive. To her daughter, Mrs. Cady was simply &#x201c;a tall, queenly looking woman,&#x201d; a female enforcer of the &#x201c;Puritan ideas,&#x201d; and the reason that &#x201c;fear, rather than love, of God and parents alike, pre�dominated&#x201d; in the household. It was she, presumably, who often placed the young Elizabeth &#x201c;under punishment for what, in those days, were called &#x2018;tantrums&#x2019;&#x201d; but that Stanton insisted were &#x201c;justi.�able acts of rebellion against the tyranny of those in authority.&#x201d;5 But Margaret Cady demonstrated both a strong will and the capacity to change; years later, in 1867, she signed a woman suffrage petition and was, according to her granddaughter Harriot, &#x201c;a dyed-in-the-wool Abolitionist,&#x201d; even a &#x201c;Garrisonian extremist.&#x201d;6 However distant and disciplined she may have been, it was not Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x2019;s &#x201c;queenly&#x201d; mother alone who upheld the family&#x2019;s conservative atti�tudes. Unfortunately, neither Stanton&#x2019;s account nor other historical documents offer clues about what ambivalence Margaret Cady might have felt about her rebellious daughter. <br>If, in Stanton&#x2019;s recollections, Judge Cady embodied the hard-line patriarchal attitudes that shaped his daughter&#x2019;s rebellion, Mrs. Cady was the regal exemplar of discipline, and Elizabeth Cady&#x2019;s younger sister Margaret was her &#x201c;fearless and self-reliant&#x201d; companion, the other women in the Cady household appear largely as the enforcers of conventional attitudes about women&#x2019;s place. Sister Harriet Cady, later Eaton, maintained a tight grip over Elizabeth Stanton&#x2019;s decisions even late in life, and often made the Stanton children miserable with restraint. Tryphena, the eldest, was conservative to her very bones. Not only would she oppose her younger sister&#x2019;s radical proclamations and actions, but, as Harriot Stanton Blatch recalled, &#x201c; &#x2018;Aunty By&#x2019; had a leaning to the southern side in Civil War days.&#x201d; Even Margaret Cady was, as her granddaughter recalled, &#x201c;much freer and .ner . . . without the aunts weaving nets of convention about her.&#x201d;7 <br>Gender conventions were not the only vestiges of tradition in the Cady household. Among Stanton&#x2019;s most quoted reminiscences are stories about the &#x201c;three colored men, Abraham, Peter, and Jacob, who acted as menservants in our youth.&#x201d; Peter in particular evoked the &#x201c;most pleasant recollections,&#x201d; for Stanton recalled that the little girls followed him to &#x201c;the negro pew&#x201d; at their otherwise all-white church, to celebrations of the Fourth of July, and on various river-rafting expe�ditions. But Peter Teabout was not simply a &#x201c;manservant&#x201d;; he was a slave&#x2014;and he likely remained one until 1827, when the last slaves were .nally, grudgingly, emancipated in the state of New York.8 <br>Daniel Cady was hardly unique in holding slaves in Montgomery County, New York. Johnstown&#x2019;s founder, Sir William Johnson, had brought slaves to central New York in the mid-eighteenth century, and by the time the Cadys arrived, revolutionary declarations of liberty notwithstanding, the practice of holding people in bondage had expanded. Five hundred and eighty-eight enslaved African Americans lived in the county in 1790, and 712 in 1810; by 1820, when Eliza�beth Cady was .ve, 40 percent of the 152 African Americans in Johnstown still lived as slaves. Only in 1799 had the state legislature passed a law for gradual, and compensated, emancipation; a very few years before Elizabeth&#x2019;s birth, an African American man or woman in her county remained almost twice as likely to be a slave as to be free. Finally, on July 4, 1827, slavery was ended in New York. African Americans, refusing to have their day of emancipation eclipsed by their white neighbors&#x2019; own independence, pointedly waited until the following day, the .fth of July, to hold celebrations around the state.9 <br>Stanton never mentioned that day of emancipation, neither to re.ect on its implications for her father nor to consider its meaning for the supposedly greatly cherished Peter. Is it unfair to have expected an eleven-year-old to notice? By her own account she was an unusually alert child, exceptionally sensitive to injustice and mat�ters of law. Even as a young girl, she claimed, she found in the restric�tions on married women&#x2019;s property ownership deeply personal insults, and had plotted to cut them out of her father&#x2019;s legal tomes. Certainly she seethed when one of the judge&#x2019;s law students, Henry Bayard, upon being shown Elizabeth&#x2019;s new Christmas gifts, teased, &#x201c;if in due time you should be my wife, those ornaments would be mine.&#x201d;10 Surely a young woman who could be so vexed about some coral trin�kets would be affected by the knowledge that a beloved companion and chaperone of her youth was himself her father&#x2019;s property. <br>Furthermore, it is hard to imagine that the momentous emancipa�tion day passed her by entirely. The young Elizabeth Cady was enthralled with public events, and loved &#x201c;attending court&#x201d; with Peter, learning about the law, and participating in the &#x201c;numerous and pro�tracted&#x201d; gatherings surrounding each Fourth of July.11 One wonders how she could have remained untouched by the celebrations and f�tes that took place in honor of emancipation. She felt no qualms, then or later, about criticizing her father&#x2019;s adherence to convention where the st...</p><h2>Olympic Pride, American Prejudice: The Untold Story of 18 African Americans Who Defied Jim Crow and Adolf Hitler to Compete in the 1936 Berlin Olympics</h2><p><b>Discover the astonishing, inspirational, and largely unknown true story of the eighteen African American athletes who competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, defying the racism of both Nazi Germany and the Jim Crow South.</b><br><br>Set against the turbulent backdrop of a segregated United States, sixteen black men and two black women were torn between boycotting the Olympic Games in Nazi Germany or participating.

Munitions and supplies were delivered by sea at ports to directly supply the newly arrived forces. It was not long before American units began to venture into the countryside to engage the VC in the areas they controlled. Many of these areas were well inland and forward bases had to be established. These bases had to be continuously supplied and required a great deal of tonnage. Supplies had to be transported overland from the coastal ports of Qui Nhon and Cam Ranh Bay at Bong Son, An Khe, Pleiku, Dalat, and Buon Ma Thuot. Later, more inland bases were established and more seaports opened. The logistical efforts expanded and it became a major effort to run convoys to these bases. Discover the history of the little-known but vitally important improvised vehicles, or &#39;gun trucks&#39;, that were developed in-theatre in Vietnam by the vehicle crews themselves to protect convoys from Viet Cong ambushes in this highly-detailed, fully-illustrated title from our popular New Vanguard series.</p><p>Gordon L.

Following Cherry's successful book <i>The Worship Architect</i>, this work helps Christian leaders think theologically and act pastorally about worship music in their churches. It addresses larger issues beyond the surface struggles of musical styles and provides tools to critically evaluate worship songs. The book is applicable to all Christian traditions and worship styles and is well suited to both the classroom and the local church. Each chapter concludes with suggested practical exercises, recommended reading, and basic vocabulary terms.</p><p><b>Engaging Worshipers in Song<br></b><br>"Worship leaders from a variety of Christian traditions will find in this single source a place to orient themselves in their vocation, plan worship, and develop a faithful and full music ministry. Few can match Cherry's education, experience, and ecumenical perspective. <i>The Music Architect </i>situates the selection of music for worship in the broader context of being a pastoral musician who makes musical decisions with pastoral sensitivity and theological integrity as well as musical skill and insight. Cherry neither takes sides in the 'worship wars' nor calls for simplistic and amorphous 'blended' worship. Her blueprint aims for careful, nuanced, and diverse possibilities that reflect the creativity of the Holy Spirit. If you want to make a sustained and authentic difference in worship through music, start here."<br>--<b>C.&nbsp;Michael Hawn</b>, University Distinguished Professor of Church Music and director of the Sacred Music Program, Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University<br><br>"What I love about this book is the clarity of thought it brings to its subject. Written with wisdom and grace, <i>The Music Architect</i> will energize and equip those who seek to lead their congregations with intelligent authenticity week by week in truly Christian worship."<br>--<b>Graham Kendrick</b>, worship leader and writer of numerous songs, including <i>Knowing You</i>; <i>Shine, Jesus, Shine</i>; <i>Servant King</i>; and <i>Amazing Love<br></i><br>"Cherry clearly expresses an architectural vision of the role of music in worship, recalling the foundation of worship in God's vision. At the same time, she also cautions readers regarding ways that music and worship can become idolatrous. New students as well as seasoned pastors and musicians will find this book valuable in the formation of disciples through song."<br>--<b>Melva Wilson Costen</b>, Helmar Neilsen Professor of Music Emerita, Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia<b>Constance M.

Why does his music affect us in the way it does?<br>&nbsp;<br>Norman Lebrecht, one of the world&#x2019;s most widely read cultural commentators, has been wrestling obsessively with Mahler for half his life. Following Mahler&#x2019;s every footstep from birthplace to grave, scrutinizing his manuscripts, talking to those who knew him, Lebrecht constructs a compelling new portrait of Mahler as a man who lived determinedly outside his own times. Mahler was&#x2014;along with Picasso, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, and Joyce&#x2014;a maker of our modern world. <i>Why Mahler? </i>is a book that shows how music can change our lives.</p></p><p><p><b>Norman Lebrecht </b>has written several best-selling works of nonfiction, including <i>The Maestro Myth</i> and <i>Who Killed Classical Music?</i> He is also the award-winning author of the novels <i>The Song of Names</i> and <i>The Game of Opposites.</i> He writes regularly for Bloomberg.com and <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> and he presents <i>The Lebrecht Interview</i> series on BBC Radio 3 and <i>The Record Doctor</i> on WNYC. He lives in London.</p><p>The Vienna of Freud, Mahler, Mach, Wittgenstein, Schnitzler, Herzl, Trotsky, and the young Hitler forged the world we know today. It was a meeting point of individualism and collectivism, egotism and idealism, the erotic and the ascetic, the elevated and the debased. At its center whirled Gustav Mahler . . . The man and his music are central to our understanding of the course of civilization and the nature of human relationships.<br>&nbsp;<br>Art that is both high and low, original and derived, breathtaking and banal, Mahler&#x2019;s music resists textbook analysis. It is an open-ended mind game of intellectual and ironic discourse, a voyage of discovery that combines self-revelation, consolation, and renewal . . . Each symphony is a search engine for inner truths. To know Mahler is ultimately to know ourselves.</p></p><h2>Sweet Promised Land, 50th ed. (The Basque Series)</h2><p>In Sweet Promised Land, Laxalt paints an affectionate portrait of his father and, simultaneously, tells the story that connects immigrant families everywhere in the United States. Dominique Laxalt, a Basque-American sheepherder, is persuaded by his family to return home for a long-planned visit after living nearly half a century on the ranges of the American West. Accompanied by his son Robert, Dominique travels to his native Basque Country in the French Pyrenees. His return to the village and mountain trails of his youth evokes ambiguous feelings as he describes to his relatives the life of hardship he has endured in the United States. The nostalgic trip to his native land ends poignantly as the elder Laxalt realizes that America has become his true home. Told with compelling sensitivity, this story portrays a family whose members share a strength of character drawn from their peasant ancestors and yet remain separated by diverse cultures on different continents.</p><p>5 1-hour cassettesRobert Laxalt grew up in Carson City, Nevada.

Ellen lives in Baltimore.</p><p>"Zager and Helfand tell the creation story from the book of Genesis in the Torah. Rhyming couplets describe the acts of creation throughout six days, beginning with words set against pitch darkness: 'The world began when God said &#x2018;light,&#x2019;/ And changed the world from dark to bright./ Dark in the night and light in the day,/ Our beautiful world was underway.' Zager&#x2019;s dynamic illustrations utilize Hebrew letters (as well as some English letters, punctuation marks, and shapes) to create the objects appearing in each scene&#x2015;they form the sun, moon, and stars created by God on the fourth day, and the shapes of bears, horses, and lions on the sixth day. Zager brings uncommon artistry to the proverbial story, inviting readers to peer more closely."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> </p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"This new picture book about the world&#x2019;s creation employs unusual, creative illustrations to deliver its story. The tale is told through rhymes of mixed quality. Following the structure of Genesis, the authors sum up each of the seven days with an appropriate, clever adjective. For example, day three is fruitful; day five is noisy. Each day&#x2019;s illustration creatively incorporates Hebrew text of that day&#x2019;s creation. Letters that spell out the word 'water' form the crests of waves; likewise, the Hebrew word for 'star' is arranged in small, bright clusters. A glossary at the volume&#x2019;s end will help readers unfamiliar with the language to appreciate what an accomplishment this is.<br> This is a welcome new picture book on a topic that has not had much press lately. Readers ages 4 to 7 will enjoy the story, and the art may even encourage readers to draw Hebrew-based pictures of their own." - <em>Jewish Book Council </em><br></p> (<i>Website</i>)<br><br><p>"In the beginning, the world was created one day at a time, according to the Creation story of the Jewish tradition. Day by day, employing simple, descriptive, accessible language, Helfand and Zager describe the first seven days of our world. The first five days are each recounted in a double-page spread, a four-line stanza in aabb verse followed by the mantra 'and there was evening and there was morning' with an appropriate description of the particular day, whether it be peaceful or noisy or lively. Day Six is described in three sets of verses, being the day on which a plethora of living things is added to those created on Day Five. Preceding the seventh day there is a quotation from the siddur, the Jewish liturgy, which describes the completion of God's work. Therefore the seventh day is not numbered but named Shabbat, the holy day of rest. Zager's imaginative, distinctive illustrations are composed from images created from Hebrew letters that reflect the words of each verse and are so intricately designed as to demand close, careful, and repeated perusal. The book is aimed at young Jewish readers, especially those who are studying or already know their "aleph-bet," able to read Hebrew. But there is definite appeal across religions and culture in the format, concept, and construction of the work. A picture glossary provides a key to the illustrations and the Hebrew words they are derived from. Soaring, uplifting, and utterly beautiful."&#x2015;starred, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Graphically imaginative and poetically told, And There Was Evening And There Was Morning by Harriet Cohen Helfand, illustrated by Ellen Kahan Zager is the creation story in rhyme. Told simply in rhyming couplets that children 3 to 8 will understand, the illustrations are at once sophisticated yet appealing for youngsters. Since the world was created with words, the artist has used Hebrew letters to create her illustrations. The more one looks at them, the more delightful and creative they are. Truly a lovely rendering of creation." - <em>Chicago Jewish Star</em></p> (<i>Newspaper</i>)</p><h2>Reading Romans in Pompeii: Paul&#39;s Letter at Ground Level</h2><p>Peter Oakes combines archeology and biblical studies to give the reader a fresher, deeper understanding of Paul's letter to the Romans.

Unlike many of the controversial and sometimes caustic works in this area, this book conclusively pinpoints the present battleground and spiritual combatants of the 21st century. As a result of his success in the Garden of Eden, Satan has unrelentingly posed his familiar Hath God said question to every generation. Unfortunately, his query has frequently accomplished its designed purpose, undermining one s faith in God s word and causing division between the Creator and His creation. One Book Stands Alone identifies the counterfeit authorities guilty of giving an uncertain sound. The reader will quickly discover how to recognize Satan s multi-pronged attack aimed at: the deity of Jesus Christ scriptural purity and preservation salvation by grace without works the supremacy of preaching Christ s sinless perfection the teaching of moral absolutes the total elimination of certain key verses and doctrines The main objective of this work was clearly recognized by Dr. Lee Roberson when he stated, One Book Stands Alone is a spiritual masterpiece. It will strengthen your faith! In these perilous times, most men are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. I trust that the Lord will use this book to strengthen your faith and help you withstand the onslaught of modern scholarship.</p><p>Dr. Douglas D. Stauffer is an internationally recognized authority in the field of Bible history and defense. He holds three Bible degrees including a PhD in Religion. Because of his biblical expertise, Oxford University Press commissioned Dr. Stauffer to work as a consulting editor. Along with being a frequent guest speaker on radio and television, he has served for ten years in pastoral ministries and logged thousands of hours teaching through the church and at the college level. He is a prolific author, having written eight books along with many writings published in Christian periodicals. While attending Bible college, Dr. Stauffer passed the CPA exam and went on to enjoy a successful career in the management of several companies. In 1995, he left his position as CFO of a multi-million-dollar corporation in order to dedicate himself more fully to the ministry. Since that time, he has earned a Th.M. in Theology and a PhD in Religion from International Baptist Seminary. One Book One Authority is Dr. Stauffer&#39;s sequel to One Book Stands Alone targeting Bible defense and history. Each of his books has been produced in segments for cable television.Required for Everybody This book is a must. I have many books on this topic, but this book is at the top. It is extremely important to get honest facts, and this book has them. Many books on this issue are written by those with an agenda to promote their world view, thus ending up being one sided. Please buy and read this book. Dan Minor --Amazon page for 2001 edition<br><br>An excellent study on the various versions of the Bible. Stauffer's book "One Book Rightly Divided" teaches you in an easily understandable manner how to correctly apply all the different sections of the Bible. This book, "One Book Stands Alone" shows you which Bible is the correct version. I was shocked when I learned the truth about the origins and the contents of many of the various versions of the Bible. Changed words and entirely deleted verses add up to inaccurate, sometimes downright blasphemous "bibles". Dr. Stauffer presents the data in a clear, easy to read, entertaining manner. If you are seeking the truth regarding which version of the Bible God wants you to read, "One Book Stands Alone" is priceless. Makes an excellent companion to "One Book Rightly Divided". Both books will be a priceless aid to new Christians and a valuable reinforcement to those already well versed in His Word.

But anyone familiar with Bernie Kosar s football career knows he didn t beat you with his physical prowess. Possessing slow feet, an awkward throwing motion and unorthodox mechanics, the kid from tough, blue-collar Youngstown, Ohio did not look like a prototype NFL quarterback. How he beat you and he beat a lot of people over the course of his college and NFL career was with a savant-like level of football intelligence and an indomitable will to win. Chronicling his rise from the hard-up steel town of his birth, to prominence as the leader of the University of Miami s first national championship team, and then to glory in the NFL with the Cleveland Browns, the ride was not smooth and seldom came without a high cost. Kosar s well-documented struggles came largely after his playing career ended, and the combination of physical, marital, familial, and financial issues transcended his uncanny ability to break down Xs and Os and ultimately cost him heavily. Exploring his personal battles, Learning to Scramble is an unvarnished and completely authentic account of an extremely talented man s ability to not only learn from his mistakes, but to evolve and develop new ways of approaching life. It s a distillation of what can be done with just a little more time and a little more opportunity all you can accomplish when you learn to scramble.</p><p>Born in Youngstown, Ohio and raised in suburban Boardman, Bernie attended Boardman High School, where he earned Parade Magazine All-American honors as a senior for the 1982 season. Kosar chose to play college football at the University of Miami, and started all 12 games as a freshman in 1983. He lead the Hurricanes to an 11 1 regular season and a berth in the Orange Bowl against top-ranked Nebraska. In the game, Kosar passed for 300 yards and two touchdowns, and the Hurricanes topped the Cornhuskers 31 30 for Miami s first national championship. Kosar earned Orange Bowl MVP honors for his performance. In 1984, he set Hurricane season records with 3,642 yards and 25 touchdowns, was a second-team All-American and finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. Kosar s career completion percentage of 62.3 percent is still a Hurricanes record. In 1985, Kosar announced that he wanted to go home to Ohio as a member of the Cleveland Browns and that he would forgo the regular NFL Draft and make himself eligible for the supplemental draft. He led the Browns to three AFC Championship games, set a league record by throwing 308 consecutive passes without an interception, and set a record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes. He went on to play for the Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins before retiring in 1996. In 2007, he brought the Arena Football League s Gladiators to Cleveland. Currently, Bernie can be seen on WEWS&#39;s weekly show. He can also frequently be heard on WTAM&#39;s Mike Trivisonno show on Mondays at 3:35pm and Thursdays at 4:40pmI have always known Bernie to be a tough competitor and a brilliant student of the game, devoted to constantly trying to get better. In this candid book, his true passion and vast knowledge about the sport shine through. --Bill Belichick, New England Patriots head coach and seven-time Super Bowl champion, including five as head coach<br><br>Bernie's story is one of adversity and strength, which is something I can certainly relate to. He handles everything that life throws at him with dignity and respect and I am proud to call him a friend. --Jim Kelly, Pro Football Hall of Famer<br><br>When I met Bernie, as a nine-year veteran I thought I had seen it all, but Bernie, a first-round savior coming home, a conquering hero with a Miami cool aura and a national championship notch on his belt, was one of the most unique athletes and personalities to ever play in the NFL. He was the best teammate, the toughest, smartest, most loyal and dedicated teammate who taught himself to excel as an NFL quarterback, with samurai gifts of anticipation and instincts that had to be seen up close to truly appreciate. Believe me, the Marinos, Elways, or Kellys may have played a "prettier" QB, but if I were picking sides for battle, I'd take Bernie. His life off the field was complicated, but anyone who knew Bernie as a friend understood that if you needed him for anything, like he played, he'd give you everything he had. --Gary Danielson, former NFL quarterback and current CBS sports analyst</p><h2>The Food Codes: Intuitive eating for every body</h2><p>What if you could never diet again? Your body knows exactly what to eat for optimal health and wellness. If you are tired of yo-yo dieting, chasing the latest eating craze, but still continuing to struggle with your weight, The Food Codes is your answer! In this book, you'll learn simple muscle testing techniques that can tell you exactly what nutrition your body needs in any moment, whether you are at home, in a restaurant, or at the grocery store. Once you master this easy testing method, you'll no longer struggle to decide what to eat, but get trusted information from your own body. The book includes a wealth of food lists, easy-to-customize recipes, and information that will help you on your journey to on-going health and wellness. &#x201c;With her groundbreaking new book, The Food Codes, Lana Nelson gives us a way of living and relating to food that has been desperately needed for as long as people have been around. You don&#x2019;t have to wonder anymore about what to eat. You don&#x2019;t have to be pulled this way and that way by the constantly changing ideas of science (and your friends&#x2019; opinions) about what foods are good for you and what foods are not. You can simply ask. The Food Codes makes the abstract idea of communicating with your own subconscious mind simple and concrete. Imagine. Your food needs, what&#x2019;s good for you and what&#x2019;s bad for you, are different from my food needs. Everyone is different, and that&#x2019;s what makes The Food Codes so eminently useful. So, you can stop listening to everyone else, change your relationship with food entirely, and start eating what your body really wants and needs. What a concept!" ~Dr. Bradley Nelson, Author of The Emotion Code</p><p></p><h2>The Philosophy of Neo-Noir (The Philosophy of Popular Culture)</h2><p>Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective&#x2015;more antihero than hero&#x2015;is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir directors push beyond the earlier genre's limitations and open new paths of cinematic and philosophical exploration.</p><p>Mark T. Conard, assistant professor of philosophy at Marymount Manhattan College in New York City, is the editor or coeditor of many books, including The Philosophy of Film Noir and The Simpsons and Philosophy."Conard can fell confident that these terrific essays will be of interest to film enthusiasts, particularly fans of Neo-Noir. Additionally, for those who come to this volume with some background in philosophy, not only will they be pleased to find fellow philosophers offering accessible introductions to philosophical thinkers and ideas but they are sure to increase their understanding of noir, Neo-Noir, and many familiar film titles, as well as more deeply appreciate the ways in which popular film and television offer wide and varied avenues to doing good philosophy.

In contrast to most contemporary accounts of humanitarianism that concentrate on the last two decades, Michael Barnett ties the past to the present, connecting the antislavery and missionary movements of the nineteenth century to today&#x2019;s peacebuilding missions, the Cold War interventions in places like Biafra and Cambodia to post&#x2013;Cold War humanitarian operations in regions such as the Great Lakes of Africa and the Balkans; and the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863 to the emergence of the major international humanitarian organizations of the twentieth century. Based on extensive archival work, close encounters with many of today&#x2019;s leading international agencies, and interviews with dozens of aid workers in the field and at headquarters, Empire of Humanity provides a history that is both global and intimate. </p><p>Avoiding both romanticism and cynicism, <i>Empire of Humanity</i> explores humanitarianism&#x2019;s enduring themes, trends, and, most strikingly, ethical ambiguities. Humanitarianism hopes to change the world, but the world has left its mark on humanitarianism. Humanitarianism has undergone three distinct global ages&#x2015;imperial, postcolonial, and liberal&#x2015;each of which has shaped what humanitarianism can do and what it is. The world has produced not one humanitarianism, but instead varieties of humanitarianism. Furthermore, Barnett observes that the world of humanitarianism is divided between an emergency camp that wants to save lives and nothing else and an alchemist camp that wants to remove the causes of suffering. These camps offer different visions of what are the purpose and principles of humanitarianism, and, accordingly respond differently to the same global challenges and humanitarianism emergencies. Humanitarianism has developed a metropolis of global institutions of care, amounting to a global governance of humanity. This humanitarian governance, Barnett observes, is an empire of humanity: it exercises power over the very individuals it hopes to emancipate. </p><p>Although many use humanitarianism as a symbol of moral progress, Barnett provocatively argues that humanitarianism has undergone its most impressive gains after moments of radical inhumanity, when the "international community" believes that it must atone for its sins and reduce the breach between what we do and who we think we are. Humanitarianism is not only about the needs of its beneficiaries; it also is about the needs of the compassionate.</p></p><p><p>Michael Barnett is University Professor of International Affairs and Political Science at The George Washington University. He is author of <i>Eyewitness to a Genocide</i> and coeditor of <i>Humanitarianism in Question</i>, both from Cornell.</p><p>"It has been an immense pleasure to read Michael Barnett's <i>Empire of Humanity</i>. This well-paced and lucid book is the political history against which every other account of humanitarianism will have to be measured. Barnett opens up the field of humanitarianism for further study in a manner that few could emulate. This book has breadth and depth. It is scholarly and yet immensely readable&#x2015;anyone interested in NGOs, volunteers, practitioners, and policymakers will need to read this text to make sense of humanitarian aid today. An indispensable book."</p> (Bertrand Taithe, University of Manchester)<br><br><p>"The ability to respond to the pain of a suffering world means neither to believe in oneself blindly nor to doubt oneself into paralysis. This subtle truth emerging from the epoch of humanitarianism, as Michael Barnett panoramically reconstructs it, takes the field to an entirely new level of sophistication and reflection. Synthesizing disparate research into the past of transnational compassion, Barnett's outstanding book returns to history to make a major contribution to the study of international politics and lay the ground for a future in which sympathy and self-questioning depend on one another."</p> (Samuel Moyn, Columbia University, author of <i>The Last Utopia: Human Rights in Histor</i><i>y</i>)<br><br><p>"In <i>Empire of Humanity</i>, Michael Barnett gives a critical history and a contemporary account of humanitarian practice. Each phase is differentiated by the particular sociohistorical combination of three sets of forces&#x2015;destruction (states and warfare), production (capitalism), and compassion (norms in international relations). Barnett surveys the variety of dilemmas humanitarians have faced and the choices they have made; his compelling account is the most comprehensive and sophisticated single-volume analysis of the history and practice of humanitarianism currently available."</p> (Stephen Hopgood, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, author of <i>Keepers of the Flame: Understanding Amnesty International</i>)<br><br><p>"Michael Barnett has pulled off a tour de force with his new book, <i>Empire of Humanity</i>. He unpacks the history, myth, and manipulation of this endeavor, from the founding myths way back in that first period of globalization in the nineteenth century, through the world wars and the cold war to the complexity of today's operations. Barnett shows how humanitarianism has always been intractably tied up with the liberal aspirations of the day and the political necessity for projecting foreign policy, and how the internal angst over whether to save lives and remain neutral or to commit to challenging the causes of inhumanity, has always divided the humanitarian church. This is a solid, highly readable analytical history, standing in stark contrast to many recent works high on cynicism and hype but low on fact."</p> (Peter Walker, Irwin H. Rosenberg Professor of Nutrition and Human Security and Director of the Feinstein International Center, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University)<br><br><p>"Michael Barnett takes the reader on a fascinating intellectual journey through the rich and little known history of humanitarianism, its roots in religious tradition, and its ambiguous and conflict-ridden relationship with diplomacy and military power. <i>Empire of Humanity</i> is a great read that explains much about why the humanitarian enterprise has ended up where it now; it is thoughtful, well written, and nuanced."</p> (Andrew Natsios, Georgetown University, former vice president of World Vision U.S. (1993&#x2013;1998) and administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (2001&#x2013;2006))<br><br><p>"Returning to the Western sources of humanitarianism, Michael Barnett offers a history in the longue dur�e, from the antislavery movement to contemporary killing fields and refugee camps.

As the extramarital-affairs expert behind AOL's "Ask Peggy" forum and as a woman who's been married for 40 years to her high school sweetheart--who cheated on her for seven years while she kidded herself that he was remaining faithful--she certainly knows what she's talking about. She says that to successfully overcome an unfaithful spouse or companion, you have to work through the myths of monogamy. It's not just men, or men who travel a lot on business, or women with supermodel good looks, who cheat. It's people of all ages, all occupations: from pastors to postal workers to, well, presidents. In other words, everyone is at risk for betraying or being betrayed.<p> Studies conservatively estimate, Vaughan reveals, that 60 percent of men and 40 percent of women will have an affair. "These figures are even more significant when we consider the total number of marriages involved, since it's unlikely that all the men and women having affairs happen to be married to each other," she says. "If even half the women having affairs (or 20 percent) are married to men <i>not</i> included in the 60 percent having affairs, then at least one partner will have an affair in approximately 80 percent of all marriages." </p><p> Vaughn outlines the societal causes and supporters of affairs, from the commercialization of sex in every visible nook and cranny of our world to our lifelong tendency to surround sex with secrecy. She also lists the common desperate measures that people take when they suspect they're being cheated on, and why they don't work. (Vaughn herself resorted to becoming a gourmet cook, wearing sexy underwear, and acting like a sex fiend in bed, all to no avail.) She also tells what to expect during a confrontation, and includes copious techniques for rebuilding self-esteem. There's also information about how to choose a marriage counselor or group therapist and, even more important, when to <i>stop</i> seeing one. For couples--especially those with children--debating whether to divorce or remain married, there's plenty of proven guidance to be found here. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p><p>Peggy Vaughan is an internationally recognized expert in the area of extramarital affairs.

And for hardly a moment thereafter does Andr�-Louis Moreau lose his charismatic cool, displaying at almost every turn in the tumultuous course of his picaresque adventures the verve, the wit, the intellectual and physical adroitness, and the instant mastery of circumstance that are his birthright. Thrust by chance into the turbulent politics of the time, his successive endeavors as a lawyer, politician, actor, lover, and buffoon make for corking entertainment.

But then the English-major-turned-award-winning-science-writer had a change of heart and decided to revisit the equations and formulas that had haunted her for years. <i>The Calculus Diaries</i> is the fun and fascinating account of her year spent confronting her math phobia head on. With wit and verve, Ouellette shows how she learned to apply calculus to everything from gas mileage to dieting, from the rides at Disneyland to shooting craps in Vegas-proving that even the mathematically challenged can learn the fundamentals of the universal language.</p><p><b>Jennifer Ouellette</b> is a science journalist and the author of several books, including&nbsp;<i>The Calculus Diaries</i>, <i>The Physics of the Buffyverse</i>, and <i>Black Bodies and Quantum Cats</i>. Her work has appeared in the&nbsp;<i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Discover</i>, <i>Salon</i>, and <i>Nature</i>, among other publications. She writes a science and culture blog called <i>Cocktail Party Physics</i> on the <i>Scientific American</i>&nbsp;website. Ouellette served from 2008 to 2010 as the director of the Science and Entertainment Exchange, a program of the National Academy of Sciences that aims to foster creative collaborations between scientists and entertainment-industry professionals. She has also been the journalist in residence at the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara and an instructor at the Santa Fe Science Writing Workshop. Ouellette holds a black belt in jujitsu and lives in Los Angeles with her husband, Caltech physicist Sean Carroll."If, like me, you love the neatness of calculus but never appreciated its applications or the colourful characters who have used it through history, then these diaries are well worth a read." <br> -<i>New Scientist</i> <br><br> "In <i>The Calculus Diaries</i>, science writer Jennifer Ouellette makes maths palatable using a mix of humour, anecdote and enticing facts...Using everyday examples, such as petrol mileage and fairground rides, Ouellette makes even complex ideas such as calculus and probability appealing."<br> -<i>Nature</i> <br><br> "This dash through a daunting discipline bursts with wry wit. Ouellette uses differential equations to model the spread of zombies, and derivatives to craft the perfect diet. Sassy throughout, she reserves special barbs for subprime mortgage holders: "Chances are they weren't doing the math." <br> -<i>Discover</i> <br><br> "<i>The Calculus Diaries</i> is a great primer for anyone who needs to get over their heebie-jeebies about an upcoming calculus class, or for anyone who's ever wondered how calculus fits into everyday life and wants to be entertained, too!" <br> -Danica McKellar, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Math Doesn't Suck</i> and <i>Hot X: Algebra Exposed</i> <br><br> "I haven't had this much fun learning math since I watched The Count on 'Sesame Street' when I was three. And the Count never talked about log flumes or zombies. So <i>The Calculus Diaries</i> wins the day." <br> -AJ Jacobs, author of <i>The Know-it-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World</i> <br><br> "Zombies? Surfing? Gambling? Nobody told me calculus could be like this. To my twelfth-grade math teacher: I demand a do-over!" <br> -Carl Zimmer, author of <i>Parasite Rex</i> and <i>The Tangled Bank: An Introduction to Evolution</i> <br><br> "Back in the day, when I was close to flunking out of calculus class because I couldn't understand why it was worth my valuable time to actually understand it, I needed someone like Jennifer Ouellette to gently explain how I wrong I was. She's like every English major's dream math teacher: funny, smart, infected with communicable enthusiasm, and she can rock a Buffy reference. In this book, she hastens the day when more people are familiar with an integral function than with Justin Bieber." <br> -Peter Sagal, host, NPR's "Wait, Wait Don't Tell Me," and author of <i>The Book of Vice</i> <br><br> "In this wonderful and compulsively readable book, Jennifer Ouellette finds the signature of mathematics -- and especially calculus, of course -- in the most unexpected places, the gorgeously lunatic architecture of Spain's Antonio Gaudi, the shimmering arc of waves on a beach. Just following her on the journey is the half the fun. But the other half is learning about the natural beauty and elegance of calculations. Ouellette's ever clear and always stimulating voice is a perfect match to the subject - and The Calculus Diaries is a tour de force." <br> -Deborah Blum, author of <i>The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York</i> <br><br> "As amusing as it is enlightening, <i>The Calculus Diaries</i> is no dry survey of abstractions. It's a guide to everyday life -- to car trips and roller- coaster rides, diet and exercise, mortgages and the housing bubble, even social networking. As Ouellette modestly recounts her own learning curve, she and her husband become characters alongside eccentrics such as Newton and Gaudi and William the Conqueror. Like a great dance teacher, Ouellette steers us so gently we think we're gliding along on our own." <br> -Michael Sims, author of <i>Adam's Navel: A Natural and Cultural History of the Human Form</i> <br><br> "Jennifer Ouellette's calculus confessional is a delight, and an example of the finest kind of science writing. Her book reveals to its readers the gritty inner workings of the most important idea humans have ever thought. (Yes, calculus is that big: it's all about understanding how things change in space and time, and there just isn't much more important than that.) Ouellette's wit, her elegant wielding of metaphor, and her passion for both math and funky culture produce this crucial insight: every equation tells a story, she says, and she's right, and the tales she tells here will captivate even the most math-phobic." <br> -Tom Levenson, author of <i>Newton and the Counterfeiter</i> <br><br> "Like the movies <i>Batman Begins, Spider-Man</i>, or <i>Superman, The Calculus Diaries</i> is the story of how an insightful, creative, and hard-working young person acquires superpowers and uses them for the benefit of society. Only this tale is true: Jennifer Ouellette can't fly or spin a web, but she can spin a yarn. <i>The Calculus Diaries</i> documents the author's seduction by mathematics and her conquering of it--Eureka!--to see the world with sharper vision. For too many people math, calculus in particular, is an albatross. But Ouellette reveals math for what it is, a powerful tool for solving problems and the exquisite language we use to describe nature. Reading this book will make you smarter. And more powerful." <br> -Eric Roston, author of <i>The Carbon Age</i> <br><br> "If you ever thought that math was useless, read this book. Want to survive a zombie attack? Win at craps? Beat a zombie at craps? Well, listen to Jennifer Ouellette. The math she describes might just be your best hope if you don't want your brains to be gobbled by the undead." <br> -Charles Seife, author of <i>Zero: Biography of a Dangerous Idea</i> <br><br> "A charming and gentle introduction to important mathematical concepts and their relevance to everyday life." <br> -Leonard Mlodinow, author of <i>The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives</i></p><h2>James Bond: Nobody Lives Forever: A 007 Novel</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Jolly good fun, complete with car chases, torture chambers, and a Q-packed bag of assassination goodies.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Playboy</em></strong></p><p>A cloud hangs over James Bond as he guides his Bentley Mulsanne Turbo through the streets of Ostend at the start of a well-earned spell of leave.

Secret agent 007 is driving through France when he learns that his demonic foe Tamil Rahani will pay a fortune to whomever delivers Bond's head on a silver plate. The entire thug population of Europe is competing for the prize, and the intended victim is lucky that two luscious and daring females are traveling with him. They rescue him from certain death repeatedly as he races to meet his housekeeper, May, and the loyal secretary, Miss Moneypenny, at the clinic in Austria where May is recovering from pneumonia. Holding the winning hand, however, Rahani's gang has abducted the women and 007 must risk decapitation to save them. The mission takes the hero and his bodyguards to an island off the Florida coast where Rahani is waiting with an authentic guillotine in an impregnable castle. In true comic-book fashion, the gory chapters detail the horrors that kill almost everyone except Bond who obviously won't die until he wants to.

Roberts, includes a glossary and reader&#x2019;s notes to help the modern reader with the complexities, archaic language, and references in Beowulf. In an ancient Danish kingdom, Grendel, a brutal monster, roams the countryside nightly, spreading terror across the land. Beowulf, a warrior of great strength and courage, hears of the bloody, pitiless attacks and immediately sets sail to free the Danes from Grendel&#x2019;s bloodlust. Although Beowulf dates from the very beginning of English literature, this saga of a man who is "most kind to his people, most eager for fame" is as thrilling to us now as it was to the Anglo-Saxons who first told it over 1,000 years ago. The lively language of adventure, glory, and sacrifice-so often lost in other translations-resonates in this new Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Press Edition.</p><p></p><h2>Art Deco Notecards &amp; Envelopes</h2><p>These striking notecards embody the glamour, luxury, and exuberance of the Art Deco period, with a twist of modern whimsy.

Boldly reimagining who sex shops were for and the kinds of spaces they could be, these entrepreneurs opened sex-toy stores like Eve&#x2019;s Garden, Good Vibrations, and Babeland not just as commercial enterprises, but to provide educational and community resources as well. In <i>Vibrator Nation</i> Lynn Comella tells the fascinating history of how these stores raised sexual consciousness, redefined the adult industry, and changed women's lives. Comella describes a world where sex-positive retailers double as social activists, where products are framed as tools of liberation, and where consumers are willing to pay for the promise of better living&#x2014;one conversation, vibrator, and orgasm at a time.</p><p>Lynn Comella is Associate Professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and coeditor of <i>New Views on Pornography: Sexuality, Politics, and the Law</i>."We&#x2019;ve come a long way, baby, but as <i>Vibrator Nation</i> and <i>Buzz</i> make clear, we still may not be coming enough."

Comella provides a multilayered context, detailing the cultural climates, sex education histories and social positioning of female sexuality that the stores operated and flourished under....

And Detective John Stone was having a problem with habeas corpus, because all there was of the body, was two bare arms. Two bare arms that somebody, twelve years ago, had put in a lock up in the East Bronx. What they had done with the rest of the woman, nobody knew. But as Stone and Dehan start to investigate, two things become clear: whoever killed the woman, wanted her arms to be found, as a boast, as a challenge. And that meant they were dealing with a psychopath &#x2013; a serial killer. But who &#x2013;the biker with a taste for beating up women? Or his best pal the Satanist and devotee of Crowley? Or perhaps the neurotic IT freak who spent his leisure hours surfing the net for porn? Or maybe somebody else...? One thing Stone understands clearly, whoever it is, is a master of misdirection...</p><p></p><h2>Lost Battalion of Tet: The Breakout of 2/12th Cavalry at Hue</h2><p>Published to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Tet Offensive, this new paperback edition brings back into print a book that became an essential source for a 2006 study of the battle by the U.S. Army&#39;s Center of Military History. It takes a critical look at what went wrong in early 1968 during one of the first engagements of Tet, when a U.S. infantry battalion was ordered to attack a large North Vietnamese force near Hue City without air or artillery support. The tragic military foul-up resulted in over 60 percent casualties for the 2d Battalion, 12th Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, when the soldiers were surrounded by the enemy and began running out of ammunition. The bold decision by battalion commander Lt. Col. Richard Sweet to break out with his remaining soldiers under cover of darkness saved this encirclement from being a total disaster. Author Charles Krohn, the unit&#39;s intelligence officer at the time, provides a much-needed analysis of what took place and fills his account with details that have been confirmed as factual by other survivors. Krohn examines the battalion s involvement in two other major attacks for lessons learned when vital systems break down lessons, he says, that are timeless and applicable anywhere. This book is published in cooperation with the Association of the United States Army.</p><p>Charles A. Krohn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, is a combat veteran of Vietnam. As a civilian, he served as the Pentagon s deputy chief of public affairs from 2001 to 2004, including three months in Iraq as an adviser to the director of the Infrastructure Recons<p> <b>Chapter 1 </b></p><p><b> AMERICA'S BEST</b> </p><p> We saw the chopper approach. </p><p> The bastard rocketed us instead of the enemy positions. One soldier died instantly, and four more were wounded. The enemy, in a treeline two hundred yards in front of us, were unscathed. </p><p> When the ARVN gunners, after shooting two rounds, refused our next request to fire because the hamlet in front of us was considered friendly, Lieutenant Colonel Sweet, our battalion commander, called Colonel Campbell, the brigade commander, to explain our dilemma. Campbell said he was under pressure from division to keep us moving and ordered us to continue the attack toward Hue. It was a legal order, so there was no point in arguing. </p><p> Every man present intuitively realized he was like a sailor ordered to stay at his station on a sinking ship with no lifeboats. We were going to have to attack across an open field into foxholes and bunkers prepared solely for the purpose of discouraging anyone from getting closer. There would be no artillery support, air strikes, or helicopter rocket runs to soften the NVA positions, no smoke to conceal our attack. There was no possibility of pulling back and selecting another route, or even attacking indirectly from a flank using firepower and maneuver. No, this was going to be a frontal assault where every man would be exposed to lethal fire from the instant he got up until the dug-in enemy facing us either withdrew or was killed. </p><p> The difference in size between the 2/12th Cavalry Battalion in 1968 and the Light Brigade in 1856 was slight: our four hundred compared to their six hundred. It's true they charged for about one and a half miles with cannons on the front, right, and left, and we only had to advance two hundred yards or so, but both we and the Light Brigade offered human-wave targets that put the defenders at little risk. </p><p> It was quiet when we began to move across the otherwise nondescript field. </p><p> The ground had been cultivated at one time, so there was no place to hide. There weren't even shell craters. From behind our trees we looked out over the mud to see the enemy reinforcing their positions, ready to receive us shoulder-to-shoulder. It was the first time I used the new binoculars purchased on a recent R&amp;R in Tokyo. </p><p> I had the feeling it was going to be my last. <br> </p><p> This incident on February 3, 1968, just outside Hue was something that should have never taken place. There was no satisfactory or compelling reason for a U.S. infantry battalion to assault a fortified North Vietnamese Army force two hundred yards away over an open field with no artillery or air support. The defenders had every advantage. The only support available was a helicopter gunship that mistakenly attacked the U.S. forces instead of the NVA. A steady drizzle and heavy, low clouds meant further support from the air was unlikely for the foreseeable future. As the Americans started moving across the field just before noon, every man was a target. The Americans fired their rifles furiously as they rushed to the other side, but the NVA defenders were barely scathed. The NVA commander -- cool and firmly in control -- allowed the U.S. battalion to reach the treeline and one hundred yards beyond, withdrawing his forces slightly so the Americans could gain a foothold. His blocking forces were under orders to let the Americans in, so they would be encouraged to continue toward Hue, believing the withdrawing NVA had been defeated. </p><p> In fact, the NVA commander set a trap. As Americans labored hard to establish a hasty perimeter and consolidate their force before moving on, the NVA closed in behind the battalion with a three-to-one combat advantage in manpower and firepower. In one horrible instant, Lieutenant Colonel Sweet, the U.S. commander, realized that he was surrounded and confronted by two devastating realities: he could neither move nor maneuver his forces, and any notion of reinforcement or resupply was out of the question. No field manuals, training, or previous experience prepared him for what was to become an ultimate test of human endurance. </p><p> Nine hours after first making contact with the enemy, U.S. artillery units arrived and began firing to support the solidly surrounded infantry battalion. Ammunition available to the artillery was barely sufficient to ensure the outnumbered force was not instantly overrun, but as time passed and casualties mounted, annihilation was never ruled out by the youthful battalion commander, especially as he saw the perimeter shrink to ever-smaller circles. The size was a function of riflemen available to mount a defense. One of the battalion's four companies, normally 171 men, was down to 40. </p><p> During the next afternoon, the entrapped men saw that their fate was ordained: death or captivity. Help from higher headquarters was neither offered nor available in the time remaining. Artillery support became increasingly dangerous as the distance between attackers and defenders inexorably closed. Exhaustion, no food at all, and very little ammunition added to the despair. </p><p> The battalion commander, Dick Sweet, realizing now he was on his own to make whatever decision would save the most soldiers, pulled in his company commanders to give them a say in the options. After every commander spoke his mind, Sweet made the decision to make a run for it that night where encircling forces seemed to be the weakest. It was a gamble with high stakes. If the maneuver failed to take the enemy by surprise, the fight was over. </p><p> The dead and equipment were left behind to give those escaping every chance to succeed. Ruses were contrived to fool the NVA for a few needed minutes as the battalion started to move in single file toward a hilltop to the west. Failure meant every man for himself, an unspoken but understood reality. For the time being, the wounded would stay with the column. But they, too, faced an uncertain future. </p><p> That night, whatever force looks after infantrymen was with the remnants of the 2d Battalion, 12th Cavalry. The tattered, limping column made it to a mountaintop where the NVA could not follow. Although they didn't know it until much later, the Americans had stumbled into the headquarters of the NVA forces attacking and holding Hue. When the battalion set out toward Hue on February 3, it was supposed to take only a day to reach the city walls. It took nearly a month. <br> </p><p> During the Vietnam War, U.S. soldiers were provided more and better support than any previous fighting force in our nation's history. Supply systems pumped in countless tons of war mat�riel of every description, and a well-greased distribution network ensured there was always enough firepower on hand to support the commander's scheme of maneuver, regardless of what it took. So plentiful was the support that soldiers and commanders too, with just cause, came to take it for granted. Despite occasional lapses, there was always more than enough to feed the war machine as many beans and bullets as it could digest. </p><p> Artillery pieces could be blown up, helicopters shot down, and trucks destroyed, but there was always enough mat�riel in the pipeline to provide a replacement in a matter of days, if not hours. Ammunition dumps occasionally took a direct hit and filled the sky with incredible pyrotechnics, but the system was so robust that men fighting the ground war were rarely affected. A world-class supermarket chain couldn't do any better. </p><p> But when the system went haywire, it went truly and disastrously sour, triggering first surprise, then shock. On even rarer occasions, commanders who had the power to move battalions and brigades from one place to another momentarily forgot about the rupture in the pipeline and issued movement orders as if nothing had happened. The first order, such as sending us toward Hue, may have been innocuous enough, seemingly insignificant at the time. Yet the results after all events were played out were disastrous. Not merely sad or unfortunate, but tragic. </p><p> I use the word "tragic" advisedly, because ill-advised attack orders can trigger a chain of events that once started cannot be stopped. For many unfortunate soldiers at the end of the chain the result was death, often senseless death. That no single person could be held responsible adds to the tragic dimension. </p><p> In the case of Vietnam, all lives were lost in vain, but some more than others. If tragedy can be measured one life at a time, the story is indeed worth recording. <br> </p><p> This tragic tale began on February 1, 1968 -- the beginning of the Tet holiday -- when Major General John J. Tolson III, commander of the 1st Air Cavalry Division, was directed by higher command to send an infantry battalion toward Hue to help take pressure off besieged U.S. Marines trapped in the city who were holding on by the skin of their teeth. </p><p> Tolson alerted the commander of his 3d Brigade, Colonel Hubert S. (Bill) Campbell, who in turn called one of his battalion commanders, Lieutenant Colonel Richard S. Sweet, commanding the 2d Battalion, 12th Cavalry, or 2/12th Cav. Campbell read Sweet the order from a small sheet of Tolson's personal notepaper in the general's own handwriting. </p><blockquote> <b>Mission</b><br> (1) Seal off city on west &amp; north with right flank based on Song Huong River.<br> (2) Destroy enemy forces attempting to either reinforce or escape from Hue Citadel. </blockquote> <p> Twenty-five years later Campbell still had this message among his personal papers saved from the war, folded in quarters so he could stick it in his pocket. </p><p> Until we received our order to move toward Hue, things were pretty quiet at Camp Evans, the new headquarters of the 1st Air Cavalry Division about fifteen miles north of Hue near Highway 1. Camp Evans was the new temporary station of the 3d Brigade. Just the day before, Campbell recorded in his diary several administrative matters, including the importance of "each day each man filling five sandbags." The Tet truce was just about to begin, so it was hardly surprising that everyone acted as if the war would slow down for a fe...</p></p><h2>Leading Healthy, Growing, Multiplying, Small Groups</h2><p>In &#34;Leading Healthy, Growing, Multiplying Small Groups,&#34; Rod Dempsey and Dave Earley make the process of forming your own small group attainable.

During the past forty years, this form has been adopted by Native female artists, who are turning previously untold stories of women&#x2019;s lifestyles and achievements into ledger-style pictures. While there has been a resurgence of interest in ledger art, little has been written about these women ledger artists.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Women and Ledger Art</i> calls attention to the extraordinary achievements of these strong women who have chosen to express themselves through ledger art.

In fact, Juneau has not always been Juneau. But the place nestled against the slopes of Mount Juneau and Mount Roberts, originally named Dzantik&#x2019;i Heeni, has always been picturesque and welcoming. After a successful strike triggered nearby mining claims in the 1880s, a makeshift camp grew on the waterfront to serve the needs of adventurers and gold-seekers. As numbers increased, the settlement was called Rockville, then Harrisburg, and finally named after Joe Juneau, one of the prospectors who, guided and advised by Tlingit leader Kowee, had made the original strike. In spite of efforts to move the capital to a central location, Juneau has remained Alaska&#x2019;s capital since 1906 and continues to invite settlers, adventurers, and explorers to visit and appreciate its beautiful setting and rich history.</p><p>Ernestine Hayes was born and raised in Juneau.

Evolution, it seems, has not completely obliterated its tracks as more advanced organisms have evolved; the history of life on earth is far older&#x2014;and odder&#x2014;than many of us realize. <br> &nbsp;<br> Scattered across the globe, these remarkable plants and animals continue to mark seminal events in geological time. From a moonlit beach in Delaware, where the hardy horseshoe crab shuffles its way to a frenzy of mass mating just as it did 450 million years ago, to the dense rainforests of New Zealand, where the elusive, unprepossessing velvet worm has burrowed deep into rotting timber since before the breakup of the ancient supercontinent, to a stretch of Australian coastline with stromatolite formations that bear witness to the Precambrian dawn, the existence of these survivors offers us a tantalizing glimpse of pivotal points in evolutionary history. These are not &#x201c;living fossils&#x201d; but rather a handful of tenacious creatures of days long gone. <br> &nbsp;<br> Written in buoyant, sparkling prose, <i>Horseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms</i> is a marvelously captivating exploration of the world&#x2019;s old-timers combining the very best of science writing with an explorer&#x2019;s sense of adventure and wonder.</p><p>Richard Fortey was a senior paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London until his retirement in 2006. He is the author of several books, including <i>Fossils: The Key to the Past; The Hidden Landscape, </i>which won the Natural World Book of the Year in 1993; <i>Life: A Natural History of Four Billion Years of Life on Earth; Trilobite!, </i>which was short-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize;<i> Earth: An Intimate History; </i>and <i>Dry Storeroom No. 1: The Secret Life of the Natural History Museum.</i> He has won the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing About Science from Rockefeller University and the Michael Faraday Prize from the Royal Society.

There are, scat- tered over the globe, organisms and ecologies which still survive from earlier times. These speak to us of seminal events in the history of life. They range from humble algal mats to hardy musk oxen that linger on in the tundra as last vestiges of the Ice Age. The history of life can be approached through the fossil record; a narrative of forms that have vanished from the earth. But it can also be understood through its survivors, the animals and plants that time has left behind. My intention is to visit these organisms in the field, to take the reader on a journey to the exotic, or even everyday, places where they live. There will be landscapes to evoke, boulders to turn over, seas to pad- dle in. I shall describe the animals and plants in their natural habitats, and explain why they are important in understanding pivotal points in evolutionary history. So it will be a journey through time, as well as around the globe.<br><br>I have always thought of myself as a naturalist first, and a palaeon- tologist second, although I cannot deny that I have spent most of my life looking at thoroughly dead creatures. This book is something of a departure for me, with the focus switched to living organisms that help reveal the tree of life (see endpapers). I will frequently return to considering fossils to show how my chosen creatures root back into ancient times. I have also broken my usual rules of narrative. The logical place to start is at the beginning, which in this case would mean with the oldest and most primitive organisms. Or I could start with the present and work backwards, as in Richard Dawkins&#x2019; <i>The Ancestor&#x2019;s Tale</i>. Instead, I have opted to start somewhere in the mid- dle. This is not perversity on my part. It seemed appropriate to start my exploration in a place, biologically speaking, that is familiar to me. The ancient horseshoe crabs of Delaware Bay were somehow fit- ting, not least on account of their trilobite connections. Amid all the concern about climate change and extinction, it is encouraging to begin with an organism whose populations can still be counted in their millions. From this starting point somewhere inside the great and spreading tree of life I can climb upwards to higher twigs if I wish, or maybe even delve downwards to find the trunk. Let us begin to explore.</p><h2>Learning to Pray Through the Psalms</h2><p>Weariness. Wonder. Joy. Longing. Anger. These are the feelings of the Psalms: honest expressions of pain and joy penned by real people in the midst of real life circumstances. Though they were written centuries ago, the Psalms still resonate deeply with us today, giving voice to our thoughts and longings: "Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD." (Psalm 130:1) "God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble." (Psalm 46:1) "As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God." (Psalm 84:2) In <em>Learning to Pray Through the Psalms,</em> James W. Sire teaches us to take our appreciation for this rich book of Scripture a step further. Choosing ten specific psalms, Sire offers background information that helps us read each one with deeper insight and then lays out a meditative, step-by-step approach to using the psalmists' words as a guide for our own personal conversation with God. A group study is also included in each chapter, along with a guide for praying through the psalm in community. The Lord loves when his people pray. And his Word is a powerful tool for framing honest, intimate prayers. Sire's innovative approach will enrich our minds and our souls as we read more perceptively and pray with all of our emotions.</p><p>James W. Sire (PhD, University of Missouri), formerly a senior editor at InterVarsity Press, is an active speaker and writer. He has taught English, philosophy, theology, and short courses at many universities and seminaries. He continues to be a frequent guest lecturer in the United States and Europe. His InterVarsity Press books and Bible studies include <em>The Universe Next Door</em> (a worldviews textbook), <em>Scripture Twisting, Discipleship of the Mind, Chris Chrisman Goes to College, Why Should Anyone Believe Anything at All?, Habits of the Mind, Naming the Elephant, Learning to Pray Through the Psalms, Why Good Arguments Often Fail </em> and <em>A Little Primer on Humble Apologetics.</em>"The country of the Psalms&#x2015;its soaring mountains, cascading streams, wildflower meadows of prayers&#x2015;compels exploration. Jim Sire's wide-ranging intelligence, fused with his attentive spirit, makes him a welcome guide through this country, opening our eyes and ears&#x2015;our hearts!&#x2015;to these prayers that teach us to pray."

His struggle for freedom is said to be one of the worst cases of police and prosecutorial misconduct in American history.</p> <p>In the summer of 1977, Cook was staying in Tyler, TX. He met an attractive young woman named Linda Edwards and was invited back to her apartment for a drink and left his fingerprints on the sliding glass door. Four days later, Ms. Edwards was found brutally murdered. When the police dusted for prints, they found Cook's and immediately arrested him. Edward Jackson testified that Cook confessed to the murder during a jailhouse conversation. Jackson was set free, only to kill again several years later. Cook, on the other hand, was convicted and sentenced to death.</p> <p>He was thrown into a world for which no one could be prepared, and he survived beatings, sexual abuse, and depression; all the while, he fought against a justice system that was determined to keep him quiet and loath to admit a mistake. Through the work of a crusading group of lawyers who forced a series of retrials, his case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ordered the case be reconsidered. It wasn't until the spring of 1999 that Cook was finally able to put the nightmare behind him: long-suppressed DNA evidence had linked James Mayfield, Linda Edwards's ex-lover, to the crime.</p></p><p><p>Kerry Max Cook was born in Stuttgart, Germany, and spent much of his youth on army bases in Europe. In 1972, he and his family returned to the United States to live in Texas. Since gaining his freedom, Cook has been an outspoken advocate for legal reform. He has made numerous national and international media appearances and has lectured at Princeton, Yale, and the University of Chicago. His story was incorporated into the acclaimed play <em>The Exonerated</em>, of which he is often a cast member. He was awarded a Soros Justice Fellowship to write <em>Chasing Justice.</em></p>Despite some amateurish prose, this depressing account of an unfair criminal justice system that almost claimed the author's life deserves a wide readership alongside John Grisham's <i>The Innocent Man</i>. After being arrested in 1977 for a brutal mutilation murder in Tyler, Tex., that he did not commit, Cook, then 21 years old, was repeatedly railroaded by corrupt police officers, prosecutors and judges bent on ignoring all the rules to get him convicted. After his first trial, Cook ended up on death row and underwent a hellish ordeal behind bars; two subsequent trials ended in a mistrial and another conviction and death sentence. The subtitle notwithstanding, Cook's eventual freedom was largely due to a team of dedicated attorneys, working from the Capital Punishment Project or pro bono, who fought tooth-and-nail to obtain his freedom in the late 1990s. Readers familiar with similar travesties, such as the Randall Dale Adams case chronicled in Errol Morris's documentary <i>The Thin Blue Line,</i> will be outraged anew, especially at the authorities' deliberate disregard of another suspect, linked to the crime by an eyewitness and DNA evidence. <i>(Feb. 27)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the time since the images were taken they have been subjected to a perplexing variety of treatments: variously ignored, suppressed, distorted and above all exploited for propaganda purposes. With the use of many photographs, including some never before seen, this book traces the history of this process and asks whether the images can be true representations of the events they were depicting. Yet their provenance, Janina Struk argues, has been less important that the uses to which a wide range of political interests has put them, from the desperate attempts of the war-time underground to provide hard evidence of the death camps to the memorial museums of Europe, the US and Israel today.</p><p>Janina Struk is a freelance photographer and writer.

In Jean Heller's first mystery featuring the scrappy newspaper columnist, Deuce finds out in short order that <strong>if you mess with organized crime, you <em>have</em> to be tough--and you'd better be as much detective as reporter.</strong> When she walks into a seedy neighborhood bar in a suburb of Chicago--all six feet of her, topped with auburn curls--she's searching for a human-interest story. What she finds is Vinnie Colangelo, an aging mobster living on bad beer, cheap bourbon and regret for the life he wasted.<br> <br> Vinnie hints at secrets much bigger than his rap sheet should entitle him to, and Deuce immediately discovers that somebody's willing to kill to keep those secrets buried. She uncovers a series of crimes committed over nearly six decades, and, as <strong>her human interest story morphs into a hard-boiled, action-packed mystery, she finds herself dead center in a storm of threats and reprisals from the mob.</strong></p><p>It's not enough that the mob's after her, and corrupt government is concealing the evidence that would explain why; even her own editors, frightened of lawsuits and losing subscribers, want her off the story.</p><p>Fortunately, she has many allies: a network of loyal co-workers and contacts, even an ardent new admirer. But which ones can she trust? At least one of them, she suspects, is hiding a secret-- <strong>corruption? Murder? The veteran reporter knows: if you're talking Chicago crime scene--it's probably both</strong>.</p></p><p><p><strong>"Good reporters do not always good novelists make, but Jean Heller is both." -- </strong><em>The Boston Sunday Globe</em></p><p><strong>"Superb ...

A sensible question to ask when opening a book that teaches the reader about opposites. But maybe we should start with something a little easier? For example, it's quite&nbsp;<i>unlucky</i>&nbsp;when a Huey finds himself stranded on a hot, deserted island&#x2014;but how&nbsp;<i>lucky</i>&nbsp;it is when a fan arrives to provide some cool air!

Don&#x2019;t worry, that one will make a Huey&#x2019;s head hurt too.&nbsp;<br><br>In&nbsp;this funny concept book from the illustrator of the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling&nbsp;<i>The Day the Crayons Quit</i>, Oliver Jeffers takes us on a delightful ride through the world of contraries.</p><p><b>Oliver Jeffers</b>&nbsp;(www.oliverjeffersworld.com) makes art and tells stories.

Originally from Belfast, Northern Ireland, Oliver now lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Jeffers's minimalist, oval-shaped Hueys are back, and this time they're talking about opposites. A white Huey starts the conversation by asking a pink one, "What's the opposite of the beginning?" When no good answer is forthcoming ("Is it yes?"), the helpful Huey proceeds to introduce more opposites to his friend, such as "up" and "down" and "high" and "low." A cat who runs up a tree (but has difficulty getting back down) becomes a running motif throughout the illustrations. Blue, purple, and orange Hueys soon join the game as well, introducing such pairs as "light" and "heavy" and "happy" and "sad." Some humor is fairly sophisticated, like a Huey who can't tell the difference between a "half full" and "half empty" glass, and another who finds that the "lucky" fan that's washed ashore on his desert island "unluckily" requires an electrical outlet. Throughout, Jeffers uses his characteristic simple shapes and colors, placed amid abundant white space, to evoke humor, frustration, and surprise. As in many of his other picture books, the main text appears in a large serif font, while characters' commentary appears in smaller, cursive-style handwriting. Predictably, the opening question is revisited at the close of the book, when it's finally answered with "The end."

Following the recent whirl of interest in Mary Magdalene that was generated by <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, Marvin Meyer (<i>The Ancient Mysteries</i>) delves into the earliest texts available to reveal a disciple of great spiritual maturity who was extremely influential in the survival of Christianity. Although he is doubtful of the grand conspiracies laid out in <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, Meyers does believe that it was institutionalized sexism that caused Mary to be deliberately "marginalized" as a prostitute in the New Testament. "The portrait of Mary in literature and art as a reformed whore is impressive, but it is mistaken in terms of historical accuracy and literary interpretation," he asserts. "...It was not until the late sixth century that Po! pe Gregory the Great formally identified Mary Magdalene with the prostitute of Luke 7, and the identification stuck." In fact, Meyer claims that there is no convincing documentation to link Mary with the unnamed prostitute who washes Jesus' feet with her tears. Using his scholarly authority as well as extensive research supplied by Esther A. De Boer, Ph.D. (<i>Mary Magdalene: Beyond the Myth</i>), he helps Mary emerge from the shadows of Orthodox Church and gain her rightful place as the highly influential disciple and apostle of Jesus. He believes that Mary had a physical love relationship with Jesus, and was probably the mysterious "beloved" disciple that is mentioned in the Gospel of John. Furthermore, he believes that Jesus may have seen Mary as the most spiritually evolved disciple. Much of the book includes quotes and interpretations of the earliest literary sources available, including the recently discovered Gospel of Mary (written in the second century), as well as the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, Peter, Thomas, and Phillip. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Marvin Meyer is one of the <em>foremost</em> scholars on early Christianity and texts about Jesus outside the New Testament.

He&#x2019;s not turning the pedals.&#x201d; Aaron Green wasn&#x2019;t there simply to drive the car. Typical of young bobbies out to impress, he was constantly on the lookout for offenders.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew was older and reckoned he was wiser. He took stock. There were reflectors on the pedals and, sure enough, they weren&#x2019;t moving, but the tricycle was. Three hours to go and the boredom was getting to him.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Might as well do the business.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>He pressed the control on the dash and triggered the blue flashing lights. &#x201c;Okay, chummy, let&#x2019;s see if your brakes work.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Their patrol car slowed to tail the offending vehicle and draw in behind. The stretch of minor road near Bathampton was otherwise deserted at 2:30 in the morning.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The tricycle came to a controlled stop. Its rider turned his head in a way that involved rotating most of his upper body. He wasn&#x2019;t young.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You know what?&#x201d; Lew said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a fucking deerstalker he&#x2019;s wearing.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Still illegal,&#x201d; Aaron said.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Who does he think he is?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Fancy dress?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew got out and approached the rider of the tricycle. &#x201c;Switch off, sir.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I beg your pardon.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Deaf as well.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew shouted, &#x201c;Switch off,&#x201d; and mimed the action with his hand.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The tricyclist obeyed. The hat was definitely a deerstalker. And the rest of the clothes matched. Lew was no fashion expert but he had an idea he was looking at a Norfolk jacket worn over a check shirt and trousers kept in place by leather gaiters. Like some character out of a television costume drama.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>And the voice was vintage BBC. &#x201c;How can I be of assistance, officer?&#x201d; How patronising was that?<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Do you have a licence to ride this thing?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I do not.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew almost rubbed his hands. He was going to enjoy this. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re aware that it&#x2019;s a form of motorcycle?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I suppose it might be described as such.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;So you need a licence.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Actually, no.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What do you mean, no? You just agreed with me it&#x2019;s a motorcycle.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;In the eyes of the law, it&#x2019;s a beast of another colour, so to speak.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;A <i>what</i>?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;In point of fact this is an EAPC.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew was supposed to be the voice of authority here. He wasn&#x2019;t about to show frailty by asking what an EAPC was. &#x201c;That may be so but it&#x2019;s motor-powered. You were riding without moving your legs.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The man gave the sort of smile that gets the seat by the window. &#x201c;Only because the poor old pins aren&#x2019;t up to pedalling so far these days.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew didn&#x2019;t have any sympathy for the elderly. They did far too well out of the state with their inflation-proof pensions and all the extras. &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s a motorbike. You&#x2019;re not wearing a helmet either.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;That is true, officer.&#x201d; Far from sounding apologetic, this lawbreaker was oozing confidence.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew remained civil, but firm. &#x201c;Did you know it&#x2019;s also against the law to ride a motorcycle without a helmet?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Now the silver eyebrows peaked in concern. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re worried about my safety?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not worried. I&#x2019;m not worried in the least. I&#x2019;m telling you it&#x2019;s illegal.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh dear.&#x201d; But the concern wasn&#x2019;t for himself, it was for Lew. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you come across many drivers of motorised tricycles.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s beside the point, sir.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Forgive me, officer. I&#x2019;m trying to save you some embarrassment.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Trying to save <i>me</i>?&#x201d; Lew said.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You see I wouldn&#x2019;t be out on the public highway if I knew I was in breach of the law. However, if you&#x2019;ll bear with me a moment . . .&#x201d; He dipped his right hand towards his jacket pocket.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew reacted fast. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that!&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The startled old man almost fell off the saddle.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Put your hands where I can see them, on the handlebars. What&#x2019;s in the pocket?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Only a piece of paper. I always carry a copy of the official government advice, which I believe is still in force. I was about to invite you to look at it.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need to.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a shame, because if you did you would see that provided I don&#x2019;t exceed fifteen miles an hour and my vehicle doesn&#x2019;t weigh more than sixty kilograms and the power is not more than two hundred and fifty watts, my choice of transport&#x2014;contrary to appearance&#x2014;is not classed as a motorcycle but an electrically assisted pedal cycle.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>An EAPC.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>All this had been spoken with such self-assurance that<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew knew with a sinking heart it had to be right. The figures the old jerk had quoted were faintly familiar. Out on patrol you don&#x2019;t often come across motorised trikes. This road user was a pain in the arse, but he was in the clear. He didn&#x2019;t require a licence or a helmet. Lew should have stuck to his first impulse and told young Aaron to drive straight past. Now it was a matter of saving face. He pointed to the large bag strapped to the back of the saddle.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in that?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Nothing of interest to the police, I promise you.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Answer the question, please.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;A plastic box containing a banana and a slice of date and walnut cake.

We shared so much in life. She passed away six months ago. Examine her, by all means. And I forgot the puncture repair kit.

The power to search at a road check has to involve suspicion of a serious arrestable offence. Lew asked him to unzip the saddlebag. This involved a contortion that was clearly uncomfortable, but Lew wasn&#x2019;t going to get caught out a second time.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The vacuum flask and the sandwich box containing a banana and a wedge of cake were visible on top. And so was the lid of a plastic urn. Lew didn&#x2019;t need to meet Trixie close up.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What are the binoculars for?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re thinking I might be a peeping Tom. Absolutely not. I&#x2019;m well past that sort of nonsense.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Most people are in bed at this time of night,&#x201d; Lew said.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not compulsory. We&#x2019;re living in a free country.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Do you mind telling me where you&#x2019;re going?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A reasonable question that got an unhelpful answer. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t know until I get there, will I?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew was being led into a minefield of embarrassment. He knew it. The only mercy was that Aaron was out of earshot.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The old man added, &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t stay in one spot. They&#x2019;re moving steadily closer to Bath, you see.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>He didn&#x2019;t see. He didn&#x2019;t see at all. But he wasn&#x2019;t so stupid as to ask. He waited for something more, and he got it. <br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;They can cover as much as a mile in a single night, using hops.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;A mile a night?&#x201d; Lew pictured a colony of travelling rabbits. What was that film he&#x2019;d once seen about rabbits on the move? <i>Watership Down</i>. &#x201c;And you hope to see them through your binoculars?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Unless I can get really close and observe them with the naked eye. It depends on the terrain.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;If they&#x2019;re always moving, how do you know where to look?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I would have thought that was obvious.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Not to me, sir.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You can hear them some way off.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Hear them doing what?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Digging their holes.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>This was the moment Lew decided to quit. &#x201c;On this occasion I&#x2019;m going to leave you to it. For your own safety, I advise you to get a cycle helmet. And keep off the A roads.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m obliged to you, but I always do.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Go carefully. Other traffic may not see you coming.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The old man looked skywards. &#x201c;A full moon helps.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>You bet it does, you old loony, Lew thought, as he returned to the patrol car. He opened the door, got in and watched in silence as the tricyclist moved off.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Watership Down was a real place somewhere in Hampshire, seventy miles down the M4. The rabbits couldn&#x2019;t have travelled that distance, even at a mile a night. Must have been a different colony. Oh Christ, Lew thought, he&#x2019;s got me thinking it&#x2019;s real.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t book him, then,&#x201d; Aaron said from the world of modern policing.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Let him off with a caution?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;No need. He&#x2019;s legal.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;How can that be?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an EAPC.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Like Lew, Aaron wasn&#x2019;t betraying his ignorance. He<br> turned the car and headed back towards the lights of Bath.<br> No more was said for some time.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Eventually Aaron asked, &#x201c;Did the old bloke say what he<br> was up to?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Stalking rabbits.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;To shoot?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;To watch.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Like a safari?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Lew didn&#x2019;t smile. He was smarting from the experience.<br> He realised he hadn&#x2019;t even asked the old boy his name.<br> &#x201c;It takes all sorts.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A shout from the control room saved them both from more of the same. Some people with a ladder had been seen acting suspiciously near a church north of the city in Julian Road. In the last six months the lead had been stripped from several roofs in Bath. The thieves could make as much as twenty grand from one night&#x2019;s work.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Two patrols were ordered to the scene.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The burst of activity using blues and twos brought muchneeded distraction. Aaron jammed his foot down and they arrived first, just as two chancers from Swindon were loading their loot into the back of a pick-up truck.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Gotcha.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The arrest filled an hour profitably and made a success of what had promised to be a long, barren night. The other patrol didn&#x2019;t show up, but Lew and Aaron didn&#x2019;t mind. By the time they had delivered their prisoners to the custody centre in Keynsham and gone through the formalities with the sergeant their shift was almost over.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>It wasn&#x2019;t worth going out on the roads again. Their relief would be coming in at 7 a.m.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Cue for a coffee.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Every officer working a shift knows the final hour is the worst possible time to get involved in a fresh incident because it has to be followed through regardless of when you&#x2019;re supposed to go off duty. So Lew and Aaron weren&#x2019;t overjoyed when ordered at 6:19 to investigate a report of a naked man in Beckford Gardens.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I want, another nutcase,&#x201d; Lew said.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>They returned to the car.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;What are we dealing with here&#x2014;a drunk?&#x201d; he asked the control room as the early morning traffic moved aside for their flashing lights. &#x201c;Is he dancing in the street and singing &#x2018;I want to break free&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The operator giggled. &#x201c;You tell me when you get there.&#x201d;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</i></p><h2>Vaccination: Proved Useless &amp; Dangerous</h2><p>Vaccination - Proved Useless &amp; Dangerous is an unchanged, high-quality reprint of the original edition of 1889.

In the spacious attic of a Beverly Hills mansion belonging to John and Michelle Phillips (of the Mamas and the Papas) during the fall of 1970, Sly Stone began recording his follow-up to 1969's "Stand!" the most popular album of his band's career.</p></p><p>Miles Marshall Lewis is founder and editor of Bronx Biannual, the journal of hip-hop literature.

You can't simply display it; you have to draw people's attention to it. World-renowned negotiation and deception detection expert, business professor, and mentalist Jack Nasher offers effective, proven techniques to convince others that we are talented, trustworthy, and yes, even brilliant.</b><br><br>Nasher offers the example of Joshua Bell, possibly the world's most famous violinist. In January 2007, at rush hour, he stepped into a Washington, DC, subway station, dressed like any street busker, and began to play a $4,000,000 Stradivarius. It was part of an experiment staged by a journalist of the Washington Post, who expected Bell's skill alone to attract an immense, awed crowd. But Bell was generally ignored, and when he stopped, nobody applauded. He made $34.17.<br><br>The good news is that you don't have to accept obscurity: you can positively affect others' perception of your talent. Whether you're looking for work, giving an important presentation, seeking clients or customers for your business, or vying for a promotion, Nasher explains how to use techniques such as expectation management, verbal and nonverbal communication, the Halo Effect, competence framing, and the power of nonconformity to gain control of how others perceive you. <br><br>Competence is the most highly valued professional trait. But it's not enough to be competent, you have to convey your competence.

LaBute (born March 19, 1963)[1] is an American playwright, film director, screenwriter, and actor. He is best-known for a play that he wrote and later adapted for film, In the Company of Men (1997), which won awards from the Sundance Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Awards, and the New York Film Critics Circle. He wrote and directed the films Your Friends &amp; Neighbors (1998), Possession (2002) (based on the A.S. Byatt novel), The Shape of Things (2003) (based on his play of the same name), The Wicker Man (2006), Some Velvet Morning (2013), and Dirty Weekend (2015). He directed the films Nurse Betty (2000), Lakeview Terrace (2008), and the American adaptation of Death at a Funeral (2010). LaBute created the TV series Billy &amp; Billie, writing and directing all of the episodes and is also creator of the TV series Van Helsing. He also directed several episodes for shows such as Hell on Wheels and Billions.<p>&#x201c;LaBute meticulously plans that the shocking, climatic revelations should cast dark light upon his apparently average people.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nicholas de Jongh, The Standard</i></p><p>&#x201c;LaBute's great gift is to live in and to chronicle that murky area of not knowing, which mankind spends much of its waking life denying.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Lahr, The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;A piece whose intricate layers of treachery are worthy of David Mamet.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Paul Taylor, The Independent</i></p></p><h2>Pastoral Theology: A Reorientation</h2><p>This is a book about pastoral priorities and parochial spirituality. Mr. Thornton argues that considerations of biblical and philosophical theology, history, and psychology alike demand that pastoral work should be based on that Remnant of faithful souls-often very few in number-to be found in any parish; and that their training and direction is of very much greater importance than devising schemes to interest the multitude. He argues forcefully against the parochial activity which aims at adding numbers of individuals to the Church by methods of recruitment; this he holds to be theologically unsound and ascetically ineffective. His faith is that God will add to the Church such as are being saved when there is at the heart of the parish this Remnant living by rule, a center of adoration and charity-the rightful heir, he contends, of medieval monastic Order. There is probably no other modern work which attempts such a serious and thorough examination of the type of spirituality to which Christians can aspire in the world today.</p><p>Martin Thornton (d: 1986) was an Anglican priest and spiritual director, author, and lecturer on Ascetical theology. He was active for much of his life in the Diocese of Truro, England.</p><h2>Fingerprints of God: What Science Is Learning About the Brain and Spiritual Experience</h2><p><b><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that explores the startling discoveries that science is making about faith.<br><br>Barbara Bradley Hagerty's new book, <i>Life Reimagined: The Science, Art, and Opportunity of Midlife, </i>is out now from Riverhead Books</b></b><br><br> Is spiritual experience real? Or is it a delusion? When we pray, what happens? Can science explain God? In <i>Fingerprints of God</i>, National Public Radio religion correspondent Barbara Bradley Hagerty attempts to answer these and other vexing questions about the science of spiritual experience. Along the way she tells the story of her own intriguing spiritual evolution, delves into the discoveries science is making about how faith affects our brains and explores what near-death experiences reveal about the afterlife. The result is a rich and insightful examination of what science is learning about how and why we believe.</p><p><br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Barbara Bradley Hagerty on <i>Fingerprints of God</i></strong> <br> <p> It took me more than a decade to muster the courage to write <i>Fingerprints of God.</i> The seed was planted on June 10, 1995, when I was reporting a story for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Sunday Magazine about evangelical churches. Kathy Younge and I were sitting on a bench outside Saddleback Church. She told me that her melanoma had returned after a remission, and she believed that the disease was not meant to kill her, but to give her a transcendent purpose. As we talked, the night darkened to indigo. The streetlamp next to our bench cast a perfect circle around us, creating the eerie sense that we were actors on a stage. The temperature had dropped into the 50's. I was shivering but pinned to the spot, riveted by Kathy and her serene faith. <br><br> My body responded before my brain, alerting me to some unseen change. My skin began to tingle and my heart started beating a little faster. Imperceptibly at first, the air around us thickened; it grew warmer and heavier, as if someone had moved into the circle and was breathing on us. I glanced at Kathy. She had fallen silent mid-sentence. Neither of us spoke. Gradually, and ever so gently, I felt engulfed by a presence I could feel but could not touch. After a minute, although it seemed longer, the presence melted away. We sat quietly, while I waited for the earth to steady itself. I was too spooked to continue with the interview, and a few minutes later I was driving back to my hotel room. <br><br> But I could not shake the questions. Was that experience a delusion, or was it real? Is there a spiritual reality that exists beyond our everyday physical world? Is there evidence of God? Not just people&#x2019;s beliefs, but hard, scientific evidence? And most basic of all: Is there more than this? For a decade, I looked for books that would answer these questions. Finding none, I decided to investigate the only way I knew how &#x2013; as a journalist.<br><br> In 2006, I took a year-long leave of absence from National Public Radio to research the emerging science of spirituality. I spoke with dozens of prominent scientists who are bushwhacking through this controversial territory, often drawing the ire or ridicule of their colleagues who believe that everything can be explained by material means. In the meantime, I took a journey peppered with surprises and ridiculous situations. I traveled to Canada and donned the "God helmet" to see if activating my temporal lobes would unleash an encounter with the "divine." I attended to a peyote ceremony (although, like our former president, I barely ingested) and visited Johns Hopkins University in search of a chemical that would manufacture a mystical experience. I arranged for a minister to have his brain scanned while he prayed at the University of Pennsylvania, and tried to see if I could physically change my own brain through two weeks of meditation at the University of Wisconsin. <br><br> And I spent endless hours with people who had enjoyed dramatic spiritual experiences. Some had had spontaneous mystical experiences, right out of the blue. Some transcendent moments were triggered by a trauma, others by drugs, or epilepsy, or near-death experiences. Some people spent hundreds of hours in prayer and meditation to cultivate the ability to connect with the divine. <br><br> I confess that my exploration was not an entirely clinical. I was raised a Christian Scientist, and while I now consider myself a serious mainstream Christian, I have always believed in the presence and power of God. At the beginning I nursed a nagging concern that perhaps this God business is just a ruse, self medication in the face of certain death. I fretted that science would prove that all mystery, all transcendent experience, can be boiled down to brain chemistry and genetics. <br><br> What I found&#x2014;well, you&#x2019;ll have to see. But I can say this: By the end of my research, I had redefined God and my view of reality. And perhaps at the end of the book, you will too.</p>Barbara Bradley Hagerty is the award-winning religion correspondent for National Public Radio.

Her biological parents? Notorious serial killers. On a quest to learn more about her past, Olivia lands in the small town of Cainsville, Illinois. As she draws on long-hidden abilities, Olivia begins to realize that there are dark secrets in Cainsville&#x2014;and powers lurking in the shadows.</p><p><b>Kelley Armstrong</b>&nbsp;is the #1<i>&nbsp;New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the Otherworld series, as well as the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling young adult trilogy Darkest Powers, the Darkness Rising trilogy, and the Nadia Stafford series. She lives in rural Ontario, Canada.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><p>I waited in the shelter drop-in center for my next appointment. The murmur of children&#x2019;s voices wafted in from the play area. Low murmurs, hesitant, fractured. Guilty giggles, cut short, as if the children weren&#x2019;t sure they had anything to giggle about.</p><p>The faint smell of bleach from the toys, washed nightly, was almost overpowered by the sickly sweet smell of lilies. Vases on every table. A hundred dollars&#x2019; worth of flowers. Money better spent on shampoo and baby wipes. But the donor meant well. They always did.</p><p>People say that volunteer work is rewarding in ways no paid job can match. I wouldn&#x2019;t know about the paid part. Barely a year out of college, I&#x2019;ve never held a paying position. I know what I get out of volunteering, though, and it isn&#x2019;t the usual sanctimonious thrill of helping the less fortunate. It&#x2019;s the mirror they provide, reflecting me in ways that aren&#x2019;t always comfortable.</p><p>My 2:15 appointment was Cathy, who apologized for being late even as I assured her she wasn&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;d slid into the room with her head down, prodding her two-year-old ahead of her.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Joey,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Are those new boots? Spider-Man, huh? Very cool.&#x201d;</p><p>A furtive glance my way. A quick nod. I like kids. Can&#x2019;t say they feel the same about me. I think they can sense I was an only child, only grandchild, too, growing up in a world of adults.</p><p>Cathy headed for a rickety wooden chair, but I patted the spot beside me on the sofa. She perched on the edge of the worn red vinyl. Not the prettiest piece of furniture, but it was bright and cheery and washable. Did the clients look at all the vinyl and wood and plastic, and imagine us after hours, bleaching down everything in sight, cleaning off the contagion of their desperate lives?</p><p>&#x201c;Did you leave Amy in the playroom?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Cathy stiffened. &#x201c;Yes. The lady said it was okay&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was just asking. They&#x2019;re doing crafts at two thirty and I know she loves crafts.&#x201d;</p><p>She relaxed and nodded. She had two children under the age of four. Another on the way. And she was three months younger than me. Not that she looked it. If I saw her on the street, I&#x2019;d have added ten years. She certainly had that extra decade of life experience. Kicked out of the house at sixteen. Married by eighteen and divorced by twenty-one. A dozen jobs on her r�sum�, often more than one at a time.</p><p>Nothing could be further removed from my own experience. I live with my mother in a house bigger than the entire shelter. I have a master&#x2019;s degree from Yale. I work as a volunteer, and I don&#x2019;t even need to do that. Do I appreciate it? No. On good days, it chafes, like a dress with a scratchy tag. On bad ones, I feel like a bobcat caught in a trap, ready to gnaw my foot off to escape. Then I look at someone like Cathy, and a wave of guilt and shame stifles the restlessness.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for seeing me, Miss Jones,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Olivia, please. And I&#x2019;m here whenever you need me. You know that.&#x201d;</p><p>Cathy nodded and wound a lock of hair around her finger. Hair dyed blond almost a year ago, dark roots now to her ears; she&#x2019;d refused to color it again because the dye job had been his idea. The guy who&#x2019;d left her with those blond ends, a missing tooth, and another baby in her belly.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Melanie has been helping you look for a job,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s that going?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Her gaze stayed fixed on my chin. It always did, unless she got worked up enough, like when she&#x2019;d declared unbidden that she wasn&#x2019;t fixing her hair. Brief shows of defiance. Achingly brief. Frustratingly brief.</p><p>There was more in that lowered gaze than deference, though. I could sense it. Feel it, thrumming through the air between us.</p><p>&#x201c;Did&#x2014;?&#x201d; I began.</p><p>Joey raced past wearing a tattered backpack in the shape of an owl. It reminded me of the one that hooted outside my window that morning. A bad omen. If you believed in omens.</p><p>&#x201c;Joey!&#x201d; Cathy said. &#x201c;Stop running and sit down.&#x201d; Then, to me, &#x201c;Sorry, Miss Jones.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s fine. I was just admiring his backpack.&#x201d; I tore my gaze away. &#x201c;Did the bakery ever give you that reference?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. I cursed under my breath. Cathy&#x2019;s last job had been at a bakery. Owned by the cousin of the man who&#x2019;d left her pregnant. Her old boss now couldn&#x2019;t seem to recall how good an employee she&#x2019;d been and thus sadly could not give a reference.</p><p>I had the name of the bakery in my wallet. More than once, I&#x2019;d been tempted to help the woman remember Cathy. I had a few ideas for how to accomplish that. It&#x2019;s a satisfying image to contemplate, and it would be so much more feasible if I wasn&#x2019;t Olivia Taylor-Jones, daughter of Lena Taylor, renowned Chicago philanthropist, and Arthur Jones, owner of the iconic Mills &amp; Jones department store. But I am, and as such, I have other avenues of attack, equally effective, if somewhat lacking in drama.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s leave that for now. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll change her mind.&#x201d; Very sure. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll grab a coffee and have a look through job postings.&#x201d;</p><p>� � �</p><p>After Cathy left, I flipped through the stack of job printouts. I told myself I was making sure I hadn&#x2019;t missed a suitable one for Cathy, but I was really looking for myself. Pointless, of course. In so many ways.</p><p>My mother had always expected me to follow her example. Marry well and devote myself to volunteerism and philanthropy. Leave paid work for those who need it. Dad had been more amenable to the idea that a young woman in my position could have a career beyond organizing fund-raisers. My mother came from money&#x2014;she was the daughter of minor nobility, raised in English society. Dad had been brought up in the business world, where you were expected to work until you couldn&#x2019;t. Or until you had a fatal heart attack at the age of sixty-one, leaving behind a daughter who, ten months later, couldn&#x2019;t look at your picture without missing you so desperately it hurt.</p><p>I always thought I&#x2019;d work for Dad someday. Take over the family business eventually. It didn&#x2019;t matter if the store bored me to tears. I&#x2019;d be working with him and that would make him so happy. Except now he was gone, and I couldn&#x2019;t bear to step through the store&#x2019;s front doors.</p><p>For now, I intended to go back to school in the fall and get my doctorate in Victorian lit. No idea what I&#x2019;d use that for in the real world, but it would give me time to figure out what I wanted.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t told my mother my plans. No use stressing her out when her dream was about to come true&#x2014;her only child married, and married well. As for my fianc�, James . . . I hadn&#x2019;t told him, either. First I was checking out my options for local schools. Once that was set&#x2014;and before the wedding&#x2014;I&#x2019;d tell him. He&#x2019;d be fine with it. He didn&#x2019;t expect me to sit home and keep house for him. Not unless I wanted to. I most certainly did not want to.</p><p>� � �</p><p>When I finished tidying up, I stepped outside the front doors, and the city hit me. The screech of tires and growl of engines. The stink of exhaust and the tang of roast pork. The flash of colors&#x2014;bright shirts, neon signs, blinding blue sky.</p><p>Our family doctor used to blame my hypersensitivity on my upbringing, raised in a quiet house in the suburbs. But years of city exposure didn&#x2019;t seem to help. I&#x2019;d walk onto a busy street and every sight, sound, and smell assaulted me, my brain whirring as if trying to make sense of it all. I&#x2019;d learned to adjust&#x2014;it was part of my life. Usually it passed in a moment, as it did now. I took a deep breath and headed to the gym.</p><p><b>� � �</b></p><p>The photographer stepped back into the shadowy doorway as the young woman approached. Once she was abreast of him, he lifted his camera and held down the shutter button, silently snapping photos.</p><p>Amazing how much she looked like her mother.</p><p><b>CHAPTER TWO</b></p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky I love you,&#x201d; I whispered as I leaned over. &#x201c;Or I would be so out of here.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, a blazing grin that had every woman at the table swooning. CEO of Chicago&#x2019;s fastest growing tech firm, and son of a former senator, James Morgan isn&#x2019;t gorgeous, but that grin had landed him a spot on the city&#x2019;s most eligible bachelors list for three years running. Sadly, he wouldn&#x2019;t be eligible next year. Well, sadly for everyone else.</p><p>&#x201c;Another hour,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Then Penny has instructions to phone me with an urgent message.&#x201d;</p><p>Good. As charity dinners went, this one ranked about average, which meant somewhere between uncomfortable and excruciating. The cause was excellent&#x2014;New Orleans reconstruction. The food was just as good&#x2014;Creole by someone who obviously knew how to cook it, which meant it was heavy on the spices and not nearly as appreciated by the older crowd. Most of it got left on the plates, which had me looking around the sea of tables, mentally calculating how far that wasted food would go in some Chicago neighborhoods. But they&#x2019;d paid handsomely for it, eaten or not, and that was the point.</p><p>James&#x2019;s father had been asked to give a speech tonight. James was doing it in his stead. That happened a lot lately, as his father aged, to the point where the organizers would be surprised&#x2014;and probably disappointed&#x2014;if James Senior showed up instead.</p><p>So James was a guest of honor, which meant everyone at this table wanted to make his acquaintance, and he couldn&#x2019;t spend the meal chatting with his fianc�e. While he conversed with everyone in turn, I entertained the others. Every few minutes, his hand would brush my leg, sometimes a flirtatious tickle but usually just a pat or squeeze, a reminder that he appreciated me being there.</p><p>Finally dessert was served: Doberge cake, a New Orleans specialty, a half-dozen layers of chocolate cake with lemon and chocolate pudding between them. The meal was coming to an end, and conversation was hitting the stage of desperation.</p><p>&#x201c;So how did you two meet?&#x201d; asked the woman on my left.</p><p>&#x201c;Their families know each other.&#x201d; A man across the table answered before we could. &#x201c;Mills &amp; Jones department stores. James Mills Morgan and Olivia Taylor-Jones.&#x201d; He sat back, looking smug, as if he&#x2019;d just uncovered a secret&#x2014;and somewhat shady&#x2014;connection.</p><p>&#x201c;Our grandfathers founded the company,&#x201d; James said. &#x201c;Mine sold our shares to Liv&#x2019;s dad before I was born, but our families still get together a few times a year. Liv was always there. Usually getting into trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>A round of obliging laughter.</p><p>The woman on my left patted my arm. &#x201c;I bet you had a secret crush on him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Er, no,&#x201d; James said. &#x201c;She was seventeen before she remembered my name.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only because you look like your cousin,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s a half foot shorter than me and fifty pounds heavier.&#x201d; James turned to the others. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say Liv&#x2019;s complete lack of interest kept my ego in check.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were older,&#x201d; I said. Then hurried to add, &#x201c;Out of my league.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice save, darling. Truth is, by the time she was old enough to notice me, I&#x2019;d gone from a gawky teenager to a boring businessman. Liv prefers fighter pilots.&#x201d;</p><p>I sputtered a laugh. &#x201c;He was a computer tech in the air force.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Close enough. The point is, she was not easily wooed. I&#x2019;ve launched hostile takeovers that were easier.&#x201d;</p><p>� � �</p><p>James spoke after dinner, making an impassioned plea for donations. I would say it was a lovely speech, but that would be arrogant, considering I wrote it. I could point out that a master&#x2019;s degree in Victorian literature hardly qualifies me to write speeches about contemporary disasters, but I never did. If James was going to be my husband, I was going to be more than a bauble on his arm.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t planned to marry so young. I&#x2019;m not sure if I planned to marry at all. My parents had a great relationship but, well, it lacked what is to me an essential component of a partnership. Namely the partnership. Dad ran the business, Mum did her charity work. Never the twain shall meet. James has let me into the business side of his life from the start, and I appreciate that. So if he asks me to write him a speech, I do.</p><p>I will say, then, only that the speech was successful. Checkbooks opened. As they did, James made his way through the crowd, with me at his side. Then, so deftly that even I hardly noticed, we ended up in the back hall.</p><p>&#x201c;I think the party is that way,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Which is why we&#x2019;re going this way. You looked like you needed a break.&#x201d; He swung me into an alcove. &#x201c;And I wanted to thank you for the speech. Perfect, as always.&#x201d;</p><p>He pressed me back against the wall, lips coming to mine in the kind of deep, hungry kiss that had, a year ago, made me decide James Morgan was a lot more interesting than he looked.</p><p>When I finally needed oxygen, I pulled back and whispered in his ear, &#x201c;If you want to thank me properly, I noticed the east wing was cordoned off.&#x201d;</p><p>He chuckled. &#x201c;Dare I ask how you noticed that when we came in the west doors?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wander.&#x201d;</p><p>The chuckle deepened, and he lowered his hands to my rear, pulling me against him as he kissed my neck.</p><p>&#x201c;But it should probably wait,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You are a guest of honor, and it would be most improper&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I like improper.&#x201d;</p><p>He let me down and we zipped along the hall toward the east wing.</p><p>� � �</p><p>I leaned against the wall, skirt hiked up my hips, legs still wrapped around him.</p><p>&#x201c;I definitely need to write you more speeches,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>A rough laugh. &#x201c;I definitely need to find more occasions for you to write me speeches.&#x201d;</p><p>We rested there. It was peaceful&#x2014;the white walls, the distant voices blending into a monotone murmur, the stomach-churning mix of perfume and cologne reduced to the spicy scent of his aftershave. I buried my face against his neck, inhaled, and relaxed.</p><p>He kissed my hair. &#x201c;Speaking of speeches . . .&#x201d;</p><p>I lifted my head. He adjusted his stance, lowering me to the ground.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to ask you something.&#x201d; He cleared his throat. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t quite how I planned it. I was going to take you to a fancy dinner and pop the question . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh-huh. While I&#x2019;m flattered that the sex was so good it caused temporary amnesia, we&#x2019;re already engaged.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled. &#x201c;Yes, I know. This is a proposal of another sort. Equally terrifying in its own way. Neil Leacock came to see me today. My dad&#x2019;s former campaign manager. He&#x2014;they&#x2014;the team and its supporters&#x2014;would like me to consider running.&#x201d;</p><p>A moment passed before I could find my voice. &#x201c;For junior senator?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but not right away. They want to wait until I&#x2019;m thirty-five. For now, they&#x2019;d just like me to start heading in that direction. Grooming me.&#x201d; He took my face in his hands. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to hit you with this after the wedding, Liv. I know you might not want a life of endless speeches and endless dinners.&#x201d;</p><p>A senator&#x2019;s wife? I swore I could hear the trap snap shut on my leg. I leaned against James, hiding my reaction.</p><p>Just relax. Don&#x2019;t say anything. You need time to think this through. Play along for now.</p><p>It took a moment, but I found a smile that would fool James. I&#x2019;d minored in drama in my undergrad years. My instructors always said I was a natural. No big surprise there. Sometimes I felt as if I&#x2019;d spent my life faking it.</p><p>I smiled up at him. &#x201c;In other words, no more sex in the back hall?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Er, no . . . Actually, I was hoping that if I promised more se...</p></p><h2>Great Romantic Violin Concertos in Full Score (Dover Orchestral Music Scores)</h2><p><p>This volume presents three of the most popular violin concertos, published together in one volume for the first time:<br>Ludwig van Beethoven: Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D Major, Op. 61<br>Felix Mendelssohn: Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in E Minor, Op. 64<br>Peter Ilyitch Tchaikovsky, Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D Major, Op. 35<br>Beethoven's masterwork explored the dimensions of the classical concerto and established the form for violin concertos ever after. <i>Grove's Dictionary</i> calls Mendelssohn's composition, "one of the most significant works in the genre."

Eudora Welty contributes a bittersweet story of a one-hundred-year-old black woman whose spirit is as determined and strong as anything in nature. Bestselling author Naomi Wolf recalls her first exposure to racism growing up, examining the subtle forms it can take even among well-meaning people; bell hooks writes about the intersection between black women and feminist politics; and Joyce Carol Oates includes a one-act play in which racial stereotypes are reversed. Among the other writers featured in the collection are Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Susan Straight, Mary Morris, and Beverly Lowry. A groundbreaking anthology that reveals surprising insights and hidden truths to a subject too often clouded by misperceptions and easy assumptions,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Skin Deep</i> is a major contribution to understanding our culture.</p><p><b>Marita Golden&nbsp;</b>is the author of more than a dozen works of fiction and nonfiction. Her books include <i>After,</i>&nbsp;<i>Migrations of the Heart, Saving Our Sons</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Don&#x2019;t Play in the Sun. </i>She is the founder of the Hurston/Wright Foundation, an organization that supports African American writers. She lives in Mitchellville, Maryland.<br><br><b>Susan Shreve</b>&nbsp;is the author of several acclaimed books for young adults and children, including three books about Amanda&#x2019;s younger brother&#x2014;Joshua T. Bates.Girlfriend, you <i>don't</i> want to miss the pungent, probing questions and answers in this fascinating, timely volume. Four of <i>Skin Deep</i>'s 20 pieces have previously appeared elsewhere: Eudora Welty's "A Worn Path," Alice Walker's "The Revenge of Hannah Kemhuff," Toni Morrison's "Recitatif," and Joyce Carol Oates' "Negative." Like these more famous writers, the authors of the collection's <i>new</i> material--Lisa Page, Naomi Wolff, Retha Powers, Beverly Lowry, Patricia Browning Griffith, Mary Morris, Jewelle Gomez, Ann Filemyr, Susan Straight, Catherine Clinton, Dorothy Gilliam, bell hooks, social workers Cathleen Gray and Shirley Bryant, and both editors--are brave, disconcerting, moving, funny, and challenging as they struggle to gaze squarely at the ways American women have penetrated--and failed to penetrate--the multifarious barriers of race. This is scary territory: a landscape littered with betrayals and failures of understanding, but illuminated by precious victories and by the editors' hope that we can "both see and see beyond race," that if we "address our differences . . . [now], the issue of race in our children's generation will be, in fact, skin deep." <i>Mary Carroll</i></p><h2>The Eternity Elixir (Potion Masters)</h2><p>Twelve-year-old Gordy Stitser is one of the few people who knows the truth about the secret society of potion masters, because not only is Gordy's mom on the Board of Ruling Elixirists Worldwide (B.R.E.W.), but she has also been training Gordy in the art of potion-making.<br><br> Gordy is a natural, and every day he sneaks down to the basement lab to invent new potions using exotic ingredients like fire ant eggs, porcupine quills, and Bosnian tickling juice.<br><br> One afternoon, Gordy receives a mysterious package containing an extremely rare potion known as ''The Eternity Elixir.'' In the right hands, the Elixir continues to protect society. But in the wrong hands, it could destroy the world as we know it.<br><br> Now, sinister potion masters are on the hunt to steal the Eternity Elixir. It's up to Gordy, his parents, and his best friends, Max and Adeline, to prevent an all-out potion war.</p><p>Frank L. Cole lives with his wife and three children out West. When he&#39;s not writing books, Frank enjoys going to the movies and traveling. He is the author of nine books. He is an active promoter of reading and using your imagination and has been to more than 120 schools presenting to kids. His philosophy is &#39;&#39;With a good imagination you can solve any problem you ever come up against in life!&#39;&#39;''This first installment in a new trilogy has all the hallmarks of a grand adventure: an unknown treasure, an all-powerful enemy, and a host of secrets revealed. Adeline and Wanda both present strong supporting cast members, and Gordy's adventure is a memorable one. Fans of the archetypal hero's journey will keep turning pages.'' --<i>School Library Journal </i><br><br>''While Gordy may be weak in training, he is strong in creativity, developing potions such as Rocket Vomit, Extra Limb, and Rat Magnet. His inventions are not exactly approved by B.R.E.W (that's the Board of Ruling Elixirists Worldwide to the uninitiated), but they are effective. . . . Gordy learns that a sense of humor, the willingness to be bold, and his love for his family and friends might win the day. Wackiness and suspense keep the pages turning. A glossary of potions highlights some of the incredible brews. A spectacular beginning.'' --<i>Kirkus </i><br><br>''Gordy is the son of one of the world's most powerful Elixirists, though most of the world doesn't know such people exist. Lucky for Gordy, he exhibits the characteristics of a Dram, an apprentice of potions, and his best friends are in on the secret. Soon Gordy finds himself in possession of a package which some very evil Elixirists are out to retrieve. The Eternity Elixir is one of the most powerful potions ever, and it was created by Gordy's allegedly dead grandfather. Gordy will have to rely on his budding powers and unconventional brews, such as Rocket Vomit, to save the day. Pleasant addition of Gordy's parents as strong secondary characters (his dad hilariously finds himself cast in the role of the damsel in distress), and some background hints that the good guys aren't always so squeaky clean. Fast-paced and humorous, this should have easy appeal for fantasy fans.'' --<i>Booklist</i></p><h2>Everything That&#39;s Underneath</h2><p><p><b><i>Everything That&#x2019;s Underneath</i>, Kristi DeMeester&#x2019;s debut powerful horror collection, is full of weird, unsettling tales that recall the styles of such accomplished storytellers as Laird Barron and Tom Piccirilli.</b></p> <p>Crawl across the earth and dig in the dirt.

But the sickness will not last</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p><b>I</b> was hiding from Mrs. Stevens that day. It was cold in the barn, though not bitter, not too bad for early February. We&#x2019;d had one warm snap that hatched a few flies, then it had stormed again. There were dirty banks of snow along the roads.</p><p>I pulled my jacket tighter around my shoulders. It was too big&#x2014;it was a castoff from Mr. Stevens&#x2014;but my dress was getting too small. It was about worn-out. The blue homespun was faded and stained, and one sleeve had a long, mended tear. I didn&#x2019;t care about any of that as much as the way it pulled across my back.</p><p>It was just past sunrise. I had done my early chores&#x2014;the milk was poured into the cooling can, the milk bucket washed. Mrs. Stevens insisted on that, every day. The minute the milk was poured out, the bucket had to be scrubbed with soap in the tin basin. Every two days, I had to change the wash water.</p><p>I sighed. I knew I should go back to the house and begin the real work of the day. I just didn&#x2019;t want to.</p><p>&#x201c;My uncle Jack hasn&#x2019;t written me,&#x201d; I explained to Betsy. &#x201c;But people say it can take a year or more.&#x201d; I smiled, remembering my tall, handsome Uncle Jack with his dark hair and light blue eyes&#x2014;and his grin.</p><p>I took a long breath, and my dress rubbed against the welts on my back. They weren&#x2019;t that bad; in a few days they&#x2019;d be gone. But they hurt. My throat ached, and then, all of a sudden, my eyes stung. I pressed my lips together, hard. I did not want to cry. No amount of tear shedding was going to change Mrs. Stevens&#x2019;s temperament.</p><p>She had willow-switched me the day before . . . she was convinced I&#x2019;d taken a spoon from her mother&#x2019;s silver service set. I hadn&#x2019;t. What would I want with a spoon?</p><p>Hiram Weiss was the only other possible suspect, though, and no one would ever think he had taken it. I liked Hiram. He didn&#x2019;t talk very much, but he always nodded and smiled at me. He was from back east somewhere. Mrs. Stevens had told me he&#x2019;d had some bad luck back there. She hadn&#x2019;t said more. I think she didn&#x2019;t know anything more. Hiram was tight-lipped. But everyone liked him; no one bothered him. He was as big as they come&#x2014;broad and tall and heavy&#x2014;plenty old enough to have a wife and children, but didn&#x2019;t have either. Mrs. Stevens always complained of the amount he ate at her table&#x2014;but not to his face. Good farmhands were not so easy to find with everyone at loose ends deciding to pick up and go west.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Mrs. Stevens lost her own ding-dang spoon,&#x201d; I said. I took a breath and opened my mouth to tell Betsy more about it, to tell her how Mrs. Stevens had scowled at me when I insisted I hadn&#x2019;t taken anything of hers, how she had sent me down to the creek to cut the willow switch. But that wasn&#x2019;t what came out. What came out was this:</p><p>&#x201c;It was all over in three weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>Betsy wasn&#x2019;t looking at me as I spoke. She never did. I cleared my throat. &#x201c;The fever was wildfire fast. Everyone says so.&#x201d;</p><p>I paused while the familiar pain in my throat got worse. I couldn&#x2019;t even whisper the rest of it, about the fever that had taken Mama and Pa and Tess. It had been almost three years ago, and I could still barely even <i>think</i> it. I longed to wake up one morning and have it not be true. But every morning I woke up&#x2014;and it was.</p><p>Betsy shifted her weight. She turned her head to look at me, chewing her cud. Then she switched her ropy tail and stamped one hind hoof. A half-dozen chilly flies rose an inch from the straw, then settled again. They were too cold to fly any farther. I pulled in a long, slow breath of barn dust and hay smell.</p><p>&#x201c;On the funeral day,&#x201d; I said quietly, &#x201c;I just sat in the parlor while neighbor women fussed over the food.&#x201d;</p><p>I stopped to breathe in and out slowly, long enough to keep myself from crying. Then I went on. &#x201c;Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly, Mrs. Gleason, and Mrs. Wittmann came from their farms. I hated the smell of their cooking in Mama&#x2019;s kitchen. I just hated them for being in there at all.&#x201d; I tacked the last part on in a near whisper.</p><p>I had been six years old when the fever hit. Mrs. O&#x2019;Reilly, Mrs. Gleason, and Mrs. Wittmann: I could barely picture their faces now&#x2014;nor the faces of their children&#x2014;even though I had gone to church with all of them. I hadn&#x2019;t seen any of them even once since that day. The Stevenses were not Irish nor Catholic&#x2014;they weren&#x2019;t anything at all. So we never went to the little church that had no priest but still held prayer meetings.</p><p>I looked out the big double doors at the shade tree outside and sighed. I was twenty miles or more from my parents&#x2019; farm in Cedar County. I had never asked to go back, and Mr. Stevens had never offered to take me. But Mama and Pa and Tess were buried on a ridge behind the house my father had built. So maybe the farm I had been born on still belonged to my family. In a way, maybe it was still my real home.</p><p>I cried a little. I was used to crying. But then I hushed so I could listen for the sound of the front door. If Mrs. Stevens caught me idling, she&#x2019;d make me scrub down her porch floors with sand, or lime the privy, or something just as bad.</p><p>When I had first come, she had often twisted a strand of my hair around her finger and smiled, saying it was the color of fresh field corn. But things had changed within a month. I had never been able to figure out why. Maybe she had thought I would think of her as my mother&#x2014;she had no children of her own. But I didn&#x2019;t. I couldn&#x2019;t. My mother had laughed all the time. She had enjoyed sunrise and making bread and playing with my sister and me.</p><p>After that first month, Mrs. Stevens seemed angry with me most of the time. It was even worse now. After my last bath she had all but pulled my tangled curls out of my scalp, she had brushed my hair that hard.</p><p>&#x201c;I was so relieved when Mr. Stevens said he&#x2019;d take me in,&#x201d; I whispered to Betsy. &#x201c;I was so afraid no one would&#x2014;all the closest neighbors had big families they could barely feed. I know they all thought this was best for me, but now . . .&#x201d;</p><p>The old cow flopped her ears and stared at nothing, her jaw working steadily. She was a Jersey milker and she had a simple life. Daytime was for eating, nights were for sleeping. She stood still when I milked her morning and evening. She was glad to see me when her bag was full and heavy. In between, she paid less attention to me than a tree stump would have. Sometimes I envied her.</p><p>I sighed. The horses were more polite about listening, but they were all out of the barn this morning. Mr. Stevens had hitched Delia and Midnight to the buggy and gone to town, and Hiram had the draft horses dragging the sledge over the half-frozen ground down by the creek.</p><p>Last year&#x2019;s cornstalks were still standing, dried and brown&#x2014;Mr. Stevens had let them go last fall because of an early wet spell. Hiram Weiss had said once that Mr. Stevens hated farming. He surely wasn&#x2019;t very good at it. Yet he always seemed to have money, and I wondered more than once where it came from.</p><p>Hiram was a grand farmer, but he didn&#x2019;t have his own farm any more than I did. He told me once that New York City, where he&#x2019;d lived for a while, was full of people who couldn&#x2019;t find enough work to eat and that Scott County, Iowa, was a paradise compared to what was going on back there.</p><p>I liked Hiram. He had first come around asking for work the year before the fever took my family. He reminded me a little of my father, but younger. Pa was quiet, but he liked to hear other people talk about when to plant and how to store grain and everything in between. My mother had liked cooking for guests when we had enough to go around. So we&#x2019;d had neighbors sitting on our porch once or twice a month&#x2014;whenever anyone came by our place on their way to Davenport for dry goods or salt or to visit the courthouse.</p><p>Mrs. Stevens almost never had a caller. Mr. Stevens got in the buggy and went visiting on his own whenever he needed a conversation&#x2014;sometimes he went all the way to Davenport&#x2014;but he almost never took his wife. And I was sure he never once thought about taking me along, even though he knew I had written five letters to my uncle Jack over the past year and desperately wanted an answer to arrive at the Davenport post office. Mr. Stevens barely noticed me unless I did something wrong.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll milk early tonight if I can,&#x201d; I said to Betsy. She flicked one floppy funnel-shaped ear.</p><p>I heard a familiar mewling behind me as I picked up the milk bucket. I glanced over my shoulder and made my voice sound like I was astonished. &#x201c;Tiger? What do you want? Milk?&#x201d; Tiger didn&#x2019;t understand the joke.</p><p>The cat stretched, arching her back and her long tail. She listened to me sometimes, but only so long as I scratched her ears. If I stopped, she would stalk away, her knees stiff and her tail twitching.</p><p>&#x201c;Katie!&#x201d;</p><p>I jumped, my heart slamming at my ribs.</p><p>Mrs. Stevens has a voice like a branch scraping a tin roof when she raises it to shout&#x2014;and she sounded close. She was coming up the barn path. Why hadn&#x2019;t I heard the front door shut?</p><p>I smoothed my dress where it hung below my coat, trying to think what excuse I might give. I had finished hanging the laundry and had split stove-wood for the next day an hour quicker than usual just to warm myself up. But that wouldn&#x2019;t matter. Here I was, sitting idle and with nowhere to hide.</p><p>&#x201c;Katie Rose!&#x201d;</p><p>I stood up and ran three steps to snatch a pitchfork from its wall hooks. It was a silly ruse. Hiram kept the stalls clean and the aisles swept. What chore could I pretend to be doing with a pitchfork?</p><p>But then the door swung wide; I blinked at the sudden glare. There was an old, spreading ash tree outside, but the shade was broken by a shaft of early morning sunlight. With the sun behind her, Mrs. Stevens looked golden, like an angel. Then she stepped inside the dim barn, and she was a pinch-mouthed farmwife again.</p><p>&#x201c;Katie! Whatever do you <i>do</i> out here?&#x201d;</p><p>I knew better than to answer. Any explanation would be the wrong one, especially the truth. Talking to a cow?</p><p>&#x201c;I asked you a question.&#x201d; Mrs. Stevens put her hands on her hips.</p><p>I just stood there, my eyes down.</p><p>Mrs. Stevens sighed. &#x201c;Daydreaming and mooning again? Do you think that&#x2019;ll get the chores done? Perhaps a few hours of real work would cure you of idleness. Or maybe a long stand in the corner.&#x201d;</p><p>My whole body went stiff. I hated standing in the corner worse than extra chores or even getting a whipping. She knew it.</p><p>Mrs. Stevens suddenly tilted her head. &#x201c;Oh my,&#x201d; she breathed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s early.&#x201d;</p><p>Then I heard it, too: faint hoofbeats and the distant grating of metal-shod cartwheels. Mr. Stevens was coming home.</p><p>Mrs. Stevens had turned to face the barn door. Now she spun around and made a motion like she was shooing hens. &#x201c;Hurry!&#x201d;</p><p>I almost smiled. I was afraid of her. But she was afraid of him. Mr. Stevens never struck his wife, but he shouted and cursed sometimes if he saw her idle. And he took pride in her never talking back to him, ever. I had heard him brag about it to Hiram. When he shouted at Mrs. Stevens, she would shrink in on herself for days afterward. But she never seemed angry at him, only at herself&#x2014;and me.</p><p>&#x201c;Sssst!&#x201d; Mrs. Stevens hissed again, glaring. &#x201c;Come on, girl, come on!&#x201d;</p></p><h2>A Gathering of Finches: A Novel (Dreamcatcher)</h2><p>Based on historical characters and events, <i>A Gathering of Finches</i> tells the story of a turn-of-the-century Oregon coastal couple and the consequences of their choices, as seen through the eyes of the wife, her sister, and her Indian maid.

In her view, art is intimately linked to the origins of religious practices and to ceremonies of birth, death, transition, and transcendence. Drawing on her years in Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and Papua New Guinea, she gives examples of painting, song, dance, and drama as behaviors that enable participants to grasp and reinforce what is important to their cognitive world."&#x2015;Publishers Weekly"<i>Homo Aestheticus</i> offers a wealth of original and critical thinking. It will inform and irritate specialist, student, and lay reader alike."&#x2015;American AnthropologistA thoughtful, elegant, and provocative analysis of aesthetic behavior in the development of our species&#x2015;one that acknowledges its roots in the work of prior thinkers while opening new vistas for those yet to come. If you're reading just one book on art anthropology this year, make it hers."&#x2015;Anthropology and Humanism</p><p>All human societies throughout history have given a special place to the arts. Even nomadic peoples who own scarcely any material possessions embellish what they do own, decorate their bodies, and celebrate special occasions with music, song, and dance. A fundamentally human appetite or need is being expressed--and met--by artistic activity. As Ellen Dissanayake argues in this stimulating and intellectually far-ranging book, only by discovering the natural origins of this human need of art will we truly know what art is, what it means, and what its future might be. Describing visual display, poetic language, song and dance, music, and dramatic performance as ways by which humans have universally, necessarily, and immemorially shaped and enhanced the things they care about, Dissanayake shows that aesthetic perception is not something that we learn or acquire for its own sake but is inherent in the reconciliation of culture and nature that has marked our evolution as humans. What &#34;artists&#34; do is an intensification and exaggeration of what &#34;ordinary people&#34; do, naturally and with enjoyment--as is evident in premodern societies, where artmaking is universally practiced. Dissanayake insists that aesthetic experience cannot be properly understood apart from the psychobiology of sense, feeling, and cognition--the ways we spontaneously and commonly think and behave. If homo aestheticus seems unrecognizable in today&#39;s modern and postmodern societies, it is so because &#34;art&#34; has been falsely set apart from life, while the reductive imperatives of an acquisitive and efficiency-oriented culture require us to ignore or devalue the aesthetic part of our nature. Dissanayake&#39;s original and provocativeapproach will stimulate new thinking in the current controversies regarding multi-cultural curricula and the role of art in education. Her ideas also have relevance to contemporary art and social theory and will be of interest to all who care strongly about the arts and their place in human, and humane, life.ART</p><h2>Wonders of the World (Volume 3) (Sassi Travel, 3)</h2><p><b>Featuring stunning photography,&nbsp;<i>Wonders of the World</i> traces the history of&nbsp;many unique places and sights&#x2014;ancient wonders,&nbsp;modern and&nbsp;futuristic works of architecture, and some of nature&#x2019;s incredible gifts.</b><br><br> By the year 300 BC, the ancient Greeks had already identified their <b>seven wonders of the world</b>&#x2014;the most amazing architectural and artistic achievements of man in the ancient world.

Because the figure is so small the shadings and highlights must be emphasized to make the figure seem realistic. Mike Davidson has years of experience painting miniature military figures and in teaching the art to others. Using a combination of hobby paints and oils he is able to create a visual effect that brings life to the cast or sculpted figures. In this book Mike takes a commercially produced casting and takes the reader through the process of assembly, painting and mounting, ending with a figure that would be a proud addition to any collection. Each step is clearly photographed and captioned so that the reader may follow them. While applied to a particular figure, the lessons learned from this book will enhance any painting the reader may choose to do.</p><p></p><h2>An Autobiographical Study (Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud)</h2><p><p><strong>Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: <em>The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</em> under the general editorship of James Strachey.<br></strong></p> Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory.

Glaser persuasively argues that coming out--as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered--has biblical precedence and sacramental dimensions. Using personal and biblical illustrations, he discusses coming out as an act of vulnerability, much like a sacrificial offering of ancient times, that invokes God's presence and effects atonement, or reconciliation. In this engaging book he shows how coming out, like other sacraments, may serve as a means of grace--that is, an experience of God's unconditional love.</p></p><p><b>Chris Glaser</b> is the interim Pastor of Virginia Highland Church, a United Church of Christ and progressive Baptist congregation in the Virginia Highland neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. He is an author, lecturer, theologian, and minister. He has authored many books, including <i>Uncommon Calling: A Gay Man's Struggle to Serve the Church</i>, <i>Come Home! Reclaiming Spirituality and Community as Gay Men and Lesbians</i>, and <i>Coming Out as Sacrament</i>.Well-known Christian gay activist Glaser (Uncommon Calling, John Knox, 1996) asserts that the Christian Scriptures themselves defend the self-affirmation of gays and lesbians in the Church and provide pertinent examples of courage and opennness toward outcasts from the lives and teachings of Moses, Jesus, the Psalmist, and others. He also provides seven sample rituals of commitment and celebration (not including, it should be noted, marriage) for the Church's rejected children. Likely to become indispensable for gay and lesbian Christians, Glaser's book will be widely discussed.

At the outset, the young men seem louche but harmless, their activities limited to drinking, snacking, peering at a naked neighbor through a window, and performing karaoke. The six "aunties" are fiercely independent career women. When one of the boys executes a lethal ambush of one of the women, chaos ensues. The women band together to find the killer and exact revenge. In turn, the boys buckle down, study physics, and plot to take out their nemeses in a single blast. Who knew that a deadly "gang war" could be such fun? Murakami builds the conflict into a hilarious, spot-on satire of modern culture and the tensions between the sexes and generations.</p><p><p><strong>Ryu Murakami</strong> is the best-selling author of more than a dozen novels and the winner of Japan&#x2019;s prestigious literary award, the Akutagawa Prize. Many of his novels have been made into movies, including <em>Audition</em>. He lives in Japan.</p><p><strong>Ralph McCarthy</strong>'s translations include Ryu Murakami&#x2019;s <em>Audition</em>, <em>In the Miso Soup</em>, <em>Piercing</em>, <em>Sixty-Nine</em>, and <em>From The Fatherland, With Love</em>.</p>Murakami&#x2019;s deviously captivating novel about class and gender roles in twentieth-century Tokyo recounts the tale of six disaffected teenage boys and their attempt to satisfy an incomprehensible inner longing. Seemingly innocent, charmingly aloof, the boys spend evenings laughing uncontrollably for indeterminate reasons, belting karaoke tunes, and settling important matters with paper-rock-scissors tournaments. But their detachment turns disturbingly real when one of the boys dispassionately murders a member of the Midori Society, a group of six middle-aged women, all divorced mothers who can&#x2019;t seem to find love or happiness without one another. Once the Midoris seek their revenge, one of the funniest and strangest gang wars in recent literature ensues. As the battle becomes increasingly violent and the body count rises, the surprisingly optimistic opponents seem incapable of distinguishing the difference between defending a friend&#x2019;s honor and satisfying a lust for vengeance. Murakami&#x2019;s characters can seem unfeeling, nihilistic, and self-indulgent, but the moral weight of this darkly comic tale is rooted in a crucial era in Japan&#x2019;s history, characterized by alternating periods of peace and extreme violence. --Jonathan Fullmer</p><h2>Dream Of You: A Wait For You Novella (1001 Dark Nights)</h2><p>Abby Erickson isn&#39;t looking for a one-night stand, a relationship, or anything that involves any one-on-one time, but when she witnesses a shocking crime, she&#39;s thrust into the hands of the sexiest man she&#39;s ever seen - Colton Anders.

From one of the UK&#39;s best-loved broadcasters, purrfect for fans of The Aristocats, The Secret Life of Pets and Atticus Claw Breaks the Law. Toto the cat and her brother Silver live footloose and fancy-free in a townhouse in London. Toto is almost totally blind, and learned to trust her senses from a ninja cat-master who taught her back in Italy where they were born. By day, Toto and Silver seem to be ordinary cats, but by night, they love to have adventures! One evening, news reaches Toto that a king cobra has escaped from London Zoo! Together with help from a very posh cat and two hungry tigers, Toto and Silver must investigate. Can they find the giant snake, before it&#39;s too late? Ideal for reading aloud or for children to curl up with and read alone, the story features brilliant black and white illustrations throughout. With gentle themes of friendship, inclusivity and winning in the face of adversity, this is a hilarious must-read for all animal-loving kids! Dermot says: &#39; The idea for Toto first came to me when my wife and I rescued two stray cats from an olive grove in Italy. One of them, Toto, has been blind from birth, but we quickly realised she had ninja-like reactions. Like a lot of cat owners (or cat servants), we like to imagine our pets having secret lives when we&#39;re out or asleep. So before I knew it I was writing about Toto and her brother Silver&#39;s nocturnal adventures around London. I really hope that children who pick it up enjoy reading the adventures of our little Italian underdog (cat).&#39; Toto&#39;s second adventure, The Incredible Cheese Heist , comes out in September 2018.</p><p>Dermot O&#39;Leary Toto the Ninja Cat and the Great Snake Escape is the first book Dermot O&#39;Leary has written for children, and was inspired by his real-life cats.

As Gretel grows up, she is witness to the breakup of her parents' marriage, the ups and downs of her cousin Margot's search for love, the deterioration of a brother who passes up Harvard for a job at the Food Star, and emotional explosions that shatter the suburban quiet...</p><p>More than a collection of short stories, yet not quite a novel, <i>Local Girls</i> occupies an undefined territory between these two forms. The local girls in question are Gretel Samuelson, her best friend, Jill, her mother, Franny, and Franny's cousin Margot--four characters who weave in and out of each of the 15 related stories that chronicle the rocky years of Gretel's adolescence. That hers will be a tough row to hoe is immediately apparent in the first story, "Dear Diary," in which Alice Hoffman introduces the Samuelson family just as they are being swallowed up by the fissures that have cracked them apart. "Long before the plane touched down in Miami we could hear our parents arguing," Gretel tells us of a family vacation to Florida; "and at the hotel room they locked themselves in their room. If you ask me, working so hard at being married can backfire." It is the end of the marriage that has lasting ramifications, however, as we discover in later stories: Gretel's brilliant older brother, Jason, becomes a drug addict; their mother must battle cancer alone; and Gretel becomes involved in a destructive relationship with a drug dealer. All pretty depressing plot points, to be sure, yet Hoffman's luminous prose combined with Gretel's tart and funny perspective keeps the reader eagerly turning the pages until the very end. <p> In fact, Gretel and her family and friends are so compelling, so endearing, that the reader wishes Hoffman had chosen to give the Samuelsons a novel instead of this series of stories. In reading about Jason's descent from A student with an acceptance letter from Harvard to working in the produce section at the local supermarket and shooting heroin, for example, one can't help but feel that a lot of his motivations happen between stories; and Gretel's difficult relationship (or lack thereof) with her father and new stepmother functions mainly as a plot device, leaving the reader wanting so much more. And yet, if one is to judge the success of a book by the reader's reluctance to be done with it, then <i>Local Girls</i> is successful, for Hoffman has created a world so enticing that one is willing to overlook the minor flaws. At the end of the title story, as the now-grown Gretel and Jill discuss two teenage girls in the neighborhood who recently committed suicide, Jill remarks: "They should have just waited. That's all they had to do. They would have grown up and everything would have been all right." The same might be said of reading <i>Local Girls</i>. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><b>Alice Hoffman</b>&nbsp;is the author of more than thirty works of fiction, including <i>The Rules of Magic</i>, <i>Practical Magic</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Marriage of Opposites</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Red Garden</i>, the Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club selection&nbsp;<i>Here on Earth</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Museum of Extraordinary Things</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Dovekeepers</i>.

Until now he has always set to one side his personal experiences as a child inmate at Auschwitz. Breaking years of silence, Kulka brings together the personal and historical, in a devastating, at times poetic, account of the concentration camps and the private mythology one man constructed around his experiences.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Auschwitz is for the author a vast repository of images, memories, and reveries: &#x201c;the Metropolis of Death&#x201d; over which rules the immutable Law of Death. Between 1991 and 2001, Kulka made audio recordings of these memories as they welled up, and in <i>Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death</i> he sifts through these fragments, attempting to make sense of them. He describes the Family Camp&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s choir in which he and others performed &#x201c;Ode to Joy&#x201d; within yards of the crematoria, his final, indelible parting from his mother when the camp was liquidated, and the &#x201c;black stains&#x201d; along the roadside during the winter death march. Amidst so much death Kulka finds moments of haunting, almost unbearable beauty (for beauty, too, Kulka says, is an inescapable law).</p><p><br></p><p><br>As the author maps his interior world, readers gain a new sense of what it was to experience the Shoah from inside the camps&#x2014;both at the time, and long afterward. <i>Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death</i> is a unique and powerful experiment in how one man has tried to understand his past, and our shared history.</p></p><p>Otto Dov Kulka is Rosenbloom Professor Emeritus of Jewish History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<i>Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death </i>is a work of inner truth, depicted through images, memories, and feelings. It is thus pervaded by a sense of paradox: a meticulous historian reflecting upon the intangible; a collection of exquisite, often individual pieces about a single harsh event, and a very readable book about an unimaginable event. Above all, this is a book that enriches the reader, to an extent much belied by its slim appearance... Underpinning every page is a sense of the historian ruefully shaking his head over the power of memory... The adult <b>Kulka</b> attempts to come to terms with his memories, but at the heart of the book is the child Kulka. It is he who experienced the events, and he invented his own language in his dreams of the camp. It was <i>his </i>Auschwitz, in the way <i>he </i>lived it and understood it, as a child. He knew that death was the only certainty in the camp--'the immutable law of death,' as he puts it--but he ultimately he survived, twice, through chance. The adult relives the death and the survival repeatedly, seemingly unable to accept that he was exempted from the overriding logic of Auschwitz. 'However much I know that I must be caught,' Kulka writes, 'I always know, too, that I must be spared.' It is the dialogue between the child and the man that makes this volume so compelling. There is often an unspoken trade-off in Holocaust books. We are curiously reading about the horrors, but we are also providing the service of remembrance. But <i>Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death </i>is a very different kind of Holocaust book. There is no blatant horror. Kulka imparts the unspeakable crimes through beautiful little segments of dreams and imagination. There are three poems, published here for the first time, from an unknown young woman who thrust them into the hands of a Kapo as she went into the gas chamber. The Kapo gave them to Kulka's father. And throughout the pages there are photographs of the past and the present, the people and the places. In just 144 pages a vast emotional terrain is revealed, and made real. It is a metropolis of death, as lived throughout a life. (Ilana Bet-El <i>The Daily Beast</i> 2013-05-05)<br><br>It is almost unclassifiable...It tries to penetrate the maze of established fact and personal experience in order to arrive at what seems unreachable...Nothing else I have read comes close to this profound examination of what the Holocaust means. <b>Kulka</b> looks everywhere for loopholes in the immutability of death. His journey strikes me as a quest similar to the attempt to describe the face of God or the structure of the universe. They are too vast and too mysterious. Not that this stops us, or this author, from trying. (Linda Grant <i>New Statesman</i> 2013-01-28)<br><br>This is a great book: read it. And be grateful...So startling and so beautiful. (Bryan Appleyard <i>Sunday Times</i> 2013-02-03)<br><br>[An] astonishing book...In its essence this is not so much a book about Auschwitz as one about coming to terms with the shock of survival. Like the 11-year-old <b>Kulka</b>, who came within a few hundred meters of the crematoria, assuming that he would perish there, the writing hovers around the incineration, as he puts it, 'like a moth circles a flame.' ...What, ultimately, makes Kulka's book unlike any other first-hand account written about the camps is the authenticity of its vision of an 11-year-old boy...Whether or not setting all this down has done anything to relieve the unrelenting grip the 'metropolis of death' holds on his mind, or whether it has tightened that hold, Kulka does not say. But since he has done the rest of us--and the world--so great a kindness by writing his book, one hopes for his sake the former. (Simon Schama <i>Financial Times</i> 2013-01-25)<br><br>There are almost 50 old photographs and drawings dispersed throughout the book; it looks like W.G. Sebald's <i>Austerlitz</i>, and in some small sections drifts off into the memorial haze that many people appreciate in Sebald's last novel. <b>Kulka</b>'s memoir--though he would deny the label--is both more haunting and more knowing...This is the product of a master historian--ironic, probing, present in the past, able to connect the particular with the cosmic. His memory is in the service of deep historical understanding, rendered in evocative prose that is here eloquently translated from Hebrew. (Thomas Laqueur <i>The Guardian</i> 2013-01-25)<br><br>[A] profound and melancholy book of remembrance...Death is in these pages a constant and close companion to the living... This is a grave, poetic and horrifying account of the Holocaust which does not so much revisit the Auschwitz of the past, but the Auschwitz of <b>Kulka</b>'s inner world. It is his own internalized city, with its own enduring horror. (Arifa Akbar <i>The Independent</i> 2013-01-25)<br><br>Powerful and haunting...In [some] places the book reads like a poisoned dream. (George Walden <i>Bloomberg.com</i> 2013-03-05)<br><br>In this moving and poignant testimony, distinguished historian <b>Otto Dov Kulka</b> draws the reader into the horror of the death-camp through a montage of historical research, essays and poetical images of memory. (Shereen Low <i>Northern Echo</i> 2013-02-04)<br><br>[<b>Kulka</b>'s] aim is not to provide a precise record of his time in the camp, but rather, to evoke something of the mythscape of what he repeatedly calls 'the metropolis of death,' a place whose sole purpose (at least after the departure of international monitors) is to murder as many people in as efficient a manner as possible...Some readers of the volume may be frustrated by its lack of explicit condemnation or moral outrage, its insistence on personal rumination rather than broad critique. That, though, seems for Kulka to be the business of historiography; here he is interested in something very different: evoking the experience of a place and time that existed beyond the farthest reaches of comprehension. (James Williams <i>PopMatters</i> 2013-03-28)<br><br><i>Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death </i>makes for deeply disturbing but ultimately very rewarding reading, and is unlike any Holocaust memoir I have ever come across...This book is not a memoir in the conventional sense, but an extraordinary collection of some of the memories, ideas and dreams that make up <b>Kulka</b>'s internal landscape. (Keith Lowe <i>The Telegraph</i> 2013-02-12)</p><h2>Breaking the Alabaster Jar: Conversations with Li-Young Lee (American Readers Series)</h2><p><p><br>In the foreword to Li-Young Lee&#x2019;s first book, <i>Rose</i> (BOA Editions, 1986), Gerald Stern wrote, &#x201c;What characterizes Li-Young Lee&#x2019;s poetry is a certain kind of humility, a kind of cunning, a love of plain speech, a search for wisdom and understanding. . . . I think we are in the presence of a true spirit.&#x201d; Poetry lovers agree! <i>Rose</i> has gone on to sell more than eighty thousand copies, and Li-Young Lee has become one of the country&#x2019;s most beloved poets.</p><p><br> <i>Breaking the Alabaster Jar: Conversations with Li-Young Lee</i> is a collection of the best dozen interviews given by Li-Young Lee over the past twenty years. From a twenty-nine-year-old poet prodigy to a seasoned veteran in high demand for readings and appearances across the United States and abroad, these interviews capture Li-Young Lee at various stages of his artistic development. He not only discusses his family&#x2019;s flight from political oppression in China and Indonesia, but how that journey affected his poetry and the engaging, often painful, insights being raised a cultural outsider in America afforded him. Other topics include spirituality (primarily Christianity and Buddhism) and a wide range of aesthetic topics such as literary influences, his own writing practices, the role of formal and informal education in becoming a writer, and his current life as a famous and highly sought-after American poet.</p></p><p>Li-Young Lee was born in 1957 in Jakarta, Indonesia, of Chinese parents. His most recent book of poetry, Book of My Nights (BOA Editions, 2001), is his third. His first collection, Rose, is in its 29th printing having sold over 80000 copies. Rose is one of the best selling poetry titles in U.S. history. Dr. Earl G. Ingersoll&#39;s scholarship focuses on late 19th and early 20th century American and British literature. He has published six books based on interviews with contemporary authors including Margaret Atwood, May Sarton, Doris Lessing, Rita Dove and Lawrence Durrell. Dr. Ingersoll has taught at SUNY Brockport, New York since 1964 where he is Distinguished Professor.This book pairs celebrated Chicago poet Li-Young Lee-whose most recent book, 2001's Book of My Nights, received the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America-with a wonderful variety of interviewers, resulting in a delightful series of Q&amp;As. Unfortunately, only three of four excerpts of Lee's work are included; fortunately, the interviews stand on their own nicely. Playing off such interlocutors as PBS's Bill Moyers, fellow poets Anthony Piccione and Stan Sanvel Rubin, and an audience of Indiana University students, Lee emerges not only a serious, accomplished poet with a well-developed sense of aesthetic and philosophy, but also a skilled conversationalist with a warm sense of humor. Whether describing his family's journey from the highest levels of Chinese society to rural America (with a stopover in Indonesia) or explaining the differences between Western and Eastern concepts of past, present, and future, Lee is endlessly fascinating. Knowing Lee's work isn't necessary to enjoy the book, but its exclusion may prove frustrating, as readers will almost certainly want to pick up a few verses before the end.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yefei Lu, an experienced investor, starts with Buffett's interest in the Sanborn Map Company in 1958 and tracks nineteen more of his major investments in companies like See's Candies, the <i>Washington Post</i>, GEICO, Coca-Cola, US Air, Wells Fargo, and IBM. Accessing partnership letters, company documents, annual reports, third-party references, and other original sources, Lu pinpoints what is unique about Buffett's timing, instinct, use of outside knowledge, and postinvestment actions, and he identifies what could work well for all investors in companies big and small, domestic and global. His substantial chronology accounts for broader world events and fluctuations in the U.S. stock market, suggesting Buffett's most important trait may be the breadth of his expertise.</p><p>Yefei Lu is a portfolio manager at Shareholder Value Management AG, a value-investment company based in Frankfurt, Germany. Previously, he worked for a single-family investment office in Munich and for McKinsey &amp; Company in Berlin. He holds an MBA from the London Business School and a Bachelor of Science in Economics from Stanford University.Warren Buffett has talked extensively about his investment philosophy but unfortunately less so on actual investments.

I often do, if I&#x2019;m honest, but today it&#x2019;s worse than usual. Firstly, because I wake alone&#x2014;Johan has gone off to London for the third time this month&#x2014;and secondly, because it&#x2019;s October and it will be completely dark until almost nine o&#x2019;clock. I reluctantly get out of bed and stand awhile by the window looking out onto the harbor. It&#x2019;s not yet seven, but across the bay, cars are moving in a slow line toward the motorway. The water in the harbor is dully reflecting the moonlight through a thin, eerie layer of ice. Downstairs, my daughters have already started fighting. I glance at my phone and it&#x2019;s full of messages and missed calls, but I just can&#x2019;t face dealing with them right now. With everything going on, I&#x2019;ve hardly been in the office the last week, but I am going in today.</p><p>I take a few exaggeratedly deep breaths and keep my gaze on the moon, still high in the sky; mindfulness is the way forward, I&#x2019;ve heard. I try to see Sandefjord the way it is in summer, when it really is a joy to stand at this window, looking out over the balmy, calm inner harbor full of leisure boats, and that bright, late-evening light. We get more sun than almost anywhere else in Norway, but I must say the winters are especially wet and drab. According to the weather report, we can expect another onslaught of torrential rain this afternoon, but for now, it&#x2019;s cool and clear. I take another couple of deep breaths, mentally steeling myself for the day ahead. I guess everyone feels like the world is a dark place sometimes.</p><p>Tuesday is a crap day in my world. Especially now that Marialuz has decided to leave us halfway through her contract and I&#x2019;m stuck with no au pair. I don&#x2019;t particularly enjoy having a stranger in the house but I most certainly don&#x2019;t enjoy having to do all the work myself either. It just isn&#x2019;t possible. Especially on Tuesdays, when the girls both have after-school activities in opposite parts of town. Nicoline dances ballet at five, and Hermine swims at six. Because Nicoline finishes as six thirty p.m., I then have to drive into town to collect her, and bring her back to the pool, where we sit on ugly plastic chairs watching small children bob around in the water until seven fifteen. Nicoline whines for the full half hour we&#x2019;re there, unless I let her watch YouTube makeup tutorials on my phone and buy her candy, which I do. Obviously.</p><p>Tonight I&#x2019;m in a particularly stressed-out, irritable mood, as things didn&#x2019;t exactly go to plan at work. I bend over backward for my clients, sometimes literally, and still they complain. Angela Salomonsen had the nerve to e-mail me today, saying that the violet raw-silk cushions I commissioned handmade in Lyon look dove-gray in the particular light in her conservatory, and could I call her immediately so we could discuss this situation. These are the kinds of things I have to deal with as interior stylist in a wealthy town full of spoiled, bored wives. Sometimes I think it is a miracle that I work at all, considering I have two small children and my husband is always traveling and I have no au pair. It&#x2019;s not really like I have to, but I quite like what I do, and being me is very expensive. Also, in my circles, it&#x2019;s definitely looked upon as a bit lazy to stay at home. Unless you have a cupcake business from the kitchen counter and blog about it, which I don&#x2019;t, as I hate cupcakes and blogs.</p><p>It&#x2019;s raining hard outside, and as I watch volleys of rain slam against the floor-to-ceiling windows beyond the pool, it occurs to me that I don&#x2019;t remember the last day it didn&#x2019;t rain. I suppose October is like that in many places, but I think I&#x2019;m one of those people who is particularly sensitive to dreary skies and wet wind&#x2014;I am a Taurus, and I prefer my surroundings to be beautiful at all times.</p><p>A little boy catches my eye as the children line up at the one-meter diving board. I&#x2019;m not sure why. He&#x2019;s significantly smaller than the other children and his skin is a deep olive-brown and smooth. He&#x2019;s bouncing up and down on his heels, rubbing his arms, but his face is completely void of the goofy expressions of the other children waiting their turn. He looks frightened. I look around at the other parents who are waiting in the steamy, overheated room for someone who might be the boy&#x2019;s parents&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t remember seeing him here before. There&#x2019;s chubby Sara&#x2019;s fat mother who I always try not to have to talk to&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve heard from several people that she&#x2019;s really needy and the last thing I need is some cling-on mummy friend. There&#x2019;s Emrik&#x2019;s father&#x2014;a good-looking guy I went to school with back in the day who is now a police officer, and who I occasionally glance up at before quickly looking away. I can feel his eyes on me now but wait ten seconds longer than I want to before meeting his eyes. I give him a very faint smile and he immediately returns it, like a grateful puppy. I&#x2019;m a good girl these days, though it doesn&#x2019;t come easily to me; there was a time when I would have felt giddy with excitement at this little game, perhaps easing the top button of my blouse open, running my tongue slowly along the backs of my teeth. I scan the few remaining people for the little boy&#x2019;s parents, now pointedly ignoring Emrik&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s wanting gaze.</p><p>There are the grandparents of Hermine&#x2019;s best friend from school, Amalie, sitting closely together and sharing biscuits from an old, faded red cake tin. There is also a slim, ginger woman sitting close to the door, a heat flush creeping across her freckled white chest. She, too, is watching the boy intently, and I suppose she must be the mother.</p><p>There&#x2019;s nobody else here; I imagine the other parents are out in the parking lot, preferring their own rain-battered cocoons and a newspaper to listening to kids&#x2019; screeching voices cutting through the clammy, hot air.</p><p>Finally, Hermine&#x2019;s class finishes after two rather underwhelming attempts at diving, and she walks over to where Nicoline and I are sitting.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you see that?&#x201d; She beams, exposing the wide, fleshy gash in her mouth from six simultaneously missing teeth.</p><p>&#x201c;Fabulous,&#x201d; I say, standing up, gathering our things together and nudging Nicoline, who is watching a ten-year-old in America apply a thick layer of foundation before expertly contouring her elfin face. &#x201c;Hurry up in the changing rooms. We&#x2019;ll wait in the foyer.&#x201d;</p><p>Hermine does not hurry up in the changing rooms, and Nicoline and I wait impatiently in the brick-clad foyer, staring out at columns of rain moving back and forth across the parking lot like dancers in a ballroom. I keep checking my watch and it&#x2019;s already past 7:30 when Hermine appears, freshly blow-dried and with a lick of pink lip gloss in spite of the fact that she&#x2019;s about to step into a torrent.</p><p>I can practically feel the thin, cool stem of the wine glass in my hand and am slightly hysterical at the thought of having to deal with the girls for much longer today. They begin to argue over something as we walk out the door, and over the sounds of their high-pitched squabbling and the crash of the rain, I don&#x2019;t pick out the other sound until I&#x2019;ve taken several steps into the rain. I briefly turn around, and there is the receptionist, an older, tired-looking woman with tight gray curls and a sweater that reads &#x201c;Happy Halloween&#x201d; She&#x2019;s shouting my name into the downpour, motioning for me to come back inside, and it&#x2019;s so typical&#x2014;one of the girls must have left something behind.</p><p>&#x201c;Cecilia, right?&#x201d; she asks as I step back inside, already drenched. I notice the little boy again, the one who&#x2019;d caught my eye at the pool. He&#x2019;s sitting on a bench, staring at the floor, his hair dripping onto the brown tiles.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was wondering if you could possibly take this little boy home? Nobody has come for him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean, nobody&#x2019;s come for him?&#x201d;</p><p>The receptionist comes over to where I&#x2019;m standing near the door and lowers her voice to a near-whisper, indicating the little boy on the bench. &#x201c;Maybe there&#x2019;s a misunderstanding&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He knows where he lives. It&#x2019;s over on �ster�ya, I looked at the list, it doesn&#x2019;t seem too far from where you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, it&#x2019;s really inconvenient,&#x201d; I say, glancing back out at the black, wet night, longingly now. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there anyone else who can take him? There was a woman in there I thought was his mother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it can&#x2019;t have been; they&#x2019;ve all gone.&#x201d; Damn Hermine and her blow-dry.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you called the parents?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. The number he gave goes straight to voicemail.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t he take a bus or something?&#x201d; The receptionist gives me a slightly cold look and pointedly looks over my shoulder to the downpour outside.</p><p>Nicoline and Hermine stare with open mouths from me to the boy to the receptionist, and back to me. The idea of not actually being collected by anyone from their activities is clearly unfathomable to them, as it very well should be. What kind of parents would not turn up to pick up their child? Some people really should be prevented from reproducing in the first place.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;ll take him.&#x201d; I look at the boy, expecting him to get up and follow us to the car, but he remains sitting, staring at the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen him here before,&#x201d; I say to the receptionist. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s his name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tobias,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;He only started a few weeks ago. He&#x2019;s eight, but as he&#x2019;s quite little for his age and hasn&#x2019;t swum much previously, we moved him in with the seven-year-olds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; I try not to think of the extra half hour this kid&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; fuck-up is going to cost me and my plans for a very large glass of Chablis by the fire before Johan comes home. I walk over to where he&#x2019;s sitting.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; I say, but realize my voice sounds harsh. I kneel down next to him, and only then does he look up at me. He&#x2019;s like a sparrow, with jittery, nervous eyes, but a soft, sweet face, framed by defined, dark brows. He&#x2019;s tiny&#x2014;it seems impossible that he can be a year older than my solid, tall Hermine. There&#x2019;s something serious and un-childlike about him, and it throws me for a moment, but then I try to empathize&#x2014;it must be a result of coming from a family that forgets to pick up an eight-year-old from the swimming pool on a bitingly cold, wet October evening. &#x201c;Come,&#x201d; I say again, softer now. He doesn&#x2019;t take my outstretched hand, but does stand up, gathering his things together.</p><p>In the car, the girls are completely silent for once, and the only sound is the repetitive, fast swoosh of the windscreen wipers. Nicoline sits up front with me, staring out at the twinkling lights of the harbor as we drive through town on our way to �ster�ya. I glance in the mirror and see that Hermine is looking unselfconsciously at Tobias, whose wan little face is turned away from her, to the window. Hermine begins to draw shapes in the gathering steam on her own window; hearts with arrows through them, her initials&#x2014;H.W.&#x2014;little bunnies with smiling faces.</p><p>&#x201c;Mum?&#x201d; says Nicoline.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you drop us at our house before you take that boy home?&#x201d;</p><p>Our home is only a two-minute detour, and it would be good for the girls to get a head start on the evening routine. &#x201c;Sure. Daddy isn&#x2019;t home yet, though. He&#x2019;s landing at ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be more than twenty minutes, so you can get changed into your pajamas and brush your teeth.&#x201d; I turn into our long driveway and glance at the boy again as our house comes into view. It&#x2019;s quite an impressive sight with its shiny black roof, numerous softly lit windows, a triple garage, swimming pool just discernible through the hedges, panoramic sea views and welcoming red door. I wonder whether the boy has ever been to a home like this before, but his neutral expression betrays nothing. Back on the road, I try to make some conversation with him.</p><p>&#x201c;So, which school do you go to?&#x201d;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&#x201c;Tobias?&#x201d;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. umm, second grade? Third?&#x201d;</p><p>Silence. I give up.</p><p>I pull up at the address the receptionist wrote down on the back of a Sandefjord Sv�mmeklubb business card: �ster�ysvingen 8, but there doesn&#x2019;t seem to be anything here. I glance back at Tobias, but he sits immobile, as though he&#x2019;s never been here before.</p><p>&#x201c;Tobias? Is this where you live?&#x201d; He nods slightly, and finally, through the dark and the rain, I make out the outline of a structure set back from the road atop a rocky crag. &#x201c;Okay, bye, then,&#x201d; I say, but the boy doesn&#x2019;t move.</p><p>&#x201c;Umm, would you like me to walk you to the door?&#x201d; Slowly the boy raises his eyes to meet mine and there&#x2019;s something in the way that he looks at me that makes me anxious. He nods. I look away, back up at what looks like a small, huddled wooden house, cursing this turn of events. I could be at home now, my feet up on the new InDesign footstool, a glass of crispy wine in my hand, flicking through Scandinavian Homes, my cashmere Missoni throw across my knees, listening to the snap of flames and the howl of the wind. Instead I&#x2019;m here in the crashing rain with a mute, strange child, trying to find his parents. I run from the car up a steep gravel path to the door of the little house, the boy trailing behind me, seemingly oblivious to the onslaught of icy water. I knock on the flimsy door with peeling blue paint, but as I do, it opens a crack, as though it was never properly closed. I&#x2019;m not sure whether the booming sound rising above the hammering rain is coming from my heart or from something inside the house.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; I say loudly with fake confidence, pushing the door open all the way. The door opens straight into a living room, but the house is clearly unlived in&#x2014;there is no furniture except the bare wooden bones of a sofa in the middle of the room. There are mounds of dust everywhere, cobwebs descending from dark, moist corners, and mouse droppings scattered about. I turn around fast, to the boy standing in the doorway, no longer in doubt that the booming sound is indeed coming from my heart.</p><p>&#x201c;Tobias,&#x201d; I say, taking hold of his bony shoulders with both of my hands. &#x201c;Is this your house?&#x201d; He nods.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are your parents?&#x201d; No reaction.</p><p>&#x201c;Tobias, look at me! You have to explain to me what&#x2019;s going on here! Do you live in this house? It doesn&#x2019;t look like anyone lives here.&#x201d; He still does not answer but I follow his eyes up a narrow staircase. I run up the stairs and my steps reverberate in the hollow, empty space. I shudder to think of him just standing there downstairs, in the dark, by himself. For a brief moment I am grateful for my own two girls. For all their shortcomings and the constant annoyance of listening to their never-ending squabbles, they are nowhere near as weird as this kid.</p><p>At the top of the stairs is a white, clean-looking IKEA lamp, unplugged, but seemingly recently placed into the thick dust. I plug it in and look around in the pool of light. There are two rooms upstairs, one on either side of the stairwell, and a small water basin. In one of the rooms is a dirty mattress, propped up against the wall, and in the corner stands a bin liner overflowing with clothes.

Unfortunately, this windswept courtship is marred by many strange events-- nocturnal wanderings, spooked horses, carriage accidents, and even an apparent suicide attempt. Soon the whole Bingley family seems the target of a mysterious plot, with only the Darcys recognizing the danger.</p><p>Sinister forces are afoot and the Darcys must get to the bottom of the plot before the blushing bride descends into madness--or worse.</p></p><p><p><b>Carrie Bebris</b> is a former school teacher and editor for TSR. A member in good standing of the Jane Austen Society, she resides in Wisconsin.</p>In her well-crafted mystery debut, fantasy author Bebris (Pool of Radiance, etc.) picks up the action where Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice left off-on the wedding day of Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy, who marry in a double ceremony with Elizabeth's older sister Jane and Charles Bingley. The Bennett brides are soon upstaged by Bingley's sister, Caroline, who announces her engagement to a Louisiana planter. Caroline's imminent nuptials mean the Darcys must remain in London, where an evening party leads to a meeting with an archeology professor who specializes in the indigenous culture of North America. Newlyweds Mr. and Mrs. Darcy later travel to Netherfield, as does the professor, who brings along some "curiosities" he's collected that he credits with unusual powers. A series of improbable events ensues, leaving one murdered house guest and two sedated hosts. Can the American artifacts hold the key to the bizarre occurrences? When an unexpected blizzard cuts the house off from the rest of the neighborhood, it's up to Mr. and Mrs. Darcy to unmask the killer and restore everyone's peace of mind. Despite an anachronism or two (e.g., summoning a constable rather than the local magistrate), the author provides convincing portraits of life in London and at Netherfield. With a touch of sorcery and lots of red herrings, Bebris works her own brand of Austen magic, whetting the reader's appetite for a sequel. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
